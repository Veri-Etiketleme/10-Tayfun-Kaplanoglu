    "### Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Improve Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are a relatively new topic, so there is little work applying this technique to Bengali character recognition. To the best of my knowledge, the only such work is by Akhand et. al, and even this applies an architecture identical to LeNet. More recent developments, such as dropout, have not been included in the architecture. In addition, the size of their dataset is ~17500 - about a fourth of the size of the augmented dataset I am using for this work.\n",

    "I tried a slightly different architecture in which the first convolutional layer used 3x3 patches instead of 5x5. My reasoning was that such a convolutional layer would capture and preserve a little more detail with respect to the small dots that form the only distinction between a lot of Bengali character pairs (for instance, ড and ড়). I also used a keep-probability of 0.5 in the dropout layer, instead of 0.75. All of this did help improve performance quite a lot. Test set accuracy is now up to <b>93.5%</b>. Validation accuracy is at 98.6%, and it is reasonable to conclude that this specific model has converged.\n",

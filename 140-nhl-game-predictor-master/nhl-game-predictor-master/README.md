## Introduction
NHL hockey games are notoriously difficult to predict. There is [common acceptance](https://www.nhlnumbers.com/2013/08/01/machine-learning-and-hockey-is-there-a-theoretical-limit-on-predictions) among hockey analytics enthusiasts that it is not possible to do better than 62% accuracy (i.e. 38% is due to luck). Interestingly, the NHL has recently [announced a partnership](https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-mgm-resorts-sports-betting-partnership/c-301392322) with MGM Resorts to enable sports betting.

> Could we do better than 62% accuracy using supervised machine learning?

At this stage the model is focused on the smaller subquestion of predicting games for **only the Vancouver Canucks**.

## Model Description

Here is **[the report](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-522_nhl-game-predictor/blob/master/doc/results_report.md)** from our initial model build which uses machine learning decision trees and random forests.

The main variables we use in this model are as follows:  
- Did the team of interest win the game? (won column, TRUE/FALSE)  
- Home or Away game? (HoA column, home/away)  
- Who is the opponent? (team_id column, 1-31)  
- What proportion of *goals* were scored by the team of interest? (calculated using goals column for both teams, 0-1)  
- What proportion of *shots* were made by the team of interest? (calculated using shots column for both teams, 0-1)  
- What proportion of *shots* were *saved* by the team of interest? (calculated using goals and shots columns, 0-1)  

## Usage

#### Using Docker

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
2. Download and clone this repository.
3. Run the following code in terminal to download the Docker image:
```
docker pull adityashrm21/dsci-522_nhl-game-predictor
```

4. Use the command line to navigate to the root of this repo.
5. Type the following code into terminal to run the analysis (filling in PATH_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER with the absolute path to the root of this project on your computer):

```
docker run --rm -it -e PASSWORD=nhlprediction -v <PATH_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER>:/home/nhl/nhl-game-predictor adityashrm21/dsci-522_nhl-game-predictor:latest make -C "/home/nhl/nhl-game-predictor" all
```

6. If you would like a fresh start, type the following:

```
docker run --rm -it -e PASSWORD=nhlprediction -v <PATH_ON_YOUR_COMPUTER>:/home/nhl/nhl-game-predictor adityashrm21/dsci-522_nhl-game-predictor:latest make -C "/home/nhl/nhl-game-predictor" clean
```

#### Using make command

Use [Makefile](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-522_nhl-game-predictor/blob/master/Makefile) to run the whole pipeline:

  - Clone this repository and then navigate to the root directory and run the following commands:

```bash
make clean # to clean up existing files and pre-existing results/images
make all # to run all the scripts and create fresh results and output
```
The description of the files and the make commands is provided below as well as in the [Makefile](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-522_nhl-game-predictor/blob/master/Makefile).

```bash

# Steps involved in the analysis

# Step 1: Cleans the data and creates train and test datasets

	Rscript source/cleaning_nhl_data.R data/game_teams_stats.csv data/train.csv data/test.csv data/team_id.txt

# Step 2: EDA along with creating relavent graph using data generated frmo step 1

	Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('doc/results_report.Rmd')"
```
#### Running scripts manually

- Clone this repo, and using the command line, navigate to the root of this project.

- Run the following commands:

```

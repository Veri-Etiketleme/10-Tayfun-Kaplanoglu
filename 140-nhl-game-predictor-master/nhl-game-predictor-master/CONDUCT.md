# Contributor Code of Conduct

**Our Pledge**  
We pledge to not be [jerks](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201201/6-reasons-why-youre-jerk). We welcome any and all genuine contributions to improve the quality of our project.

**Our Standards**  
Don't be a [jerk](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201201/6-reasons-why-youre-jerk).

**Our Responsibilities**  
We will do our best to engage with all contributions, and to be open and transparent as we try to improve the project. But know that we are busy and if we don't respond right away it is not because we hate you.

**Scope**  
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

**Enforcement**  
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the projectâ€™s leadership.

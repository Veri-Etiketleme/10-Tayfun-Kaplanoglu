daily sea ice data present show low amount global sea ice coverage beginning around october november university california student tweeted image purportedto show daily time series extent earths global sea ice every year since thedata first became available generated numerous shares appears show period beginning around area global sea ice never low time year
chart since generated spirited online debate authenticity well utility
graph question created user named climate message board arctic sea ice
user documented source data methods used analyze
numbers come set provided national snow ice data generated daily observations two nasas department defenses defense meteorological satellite
image created official governmental data publicly available
experts nasas goddard space flight center also noted reported looks since beginning first time seeing arctic antarctic sea ice running record low said walt research scientist sciences laboratory nasas goddard space flight tracked sea ice data going back image metric called global sea ice winepus also produced similar graph using different metric called sea ice
trends broadly sea ice extent yields higher estimates lower threshold point
first thing aware graph kind analysis climate researchers usually
reported jeff masters weather undergrounds nsidc usually plots hemispheres generally frown practice looking global sea ice said mark director national snow ice data reason ice two hemispheres tends behave rather arctic extent shows clear downward trends pattern antarctic much
overall shape combined plot presented winepus shows cumulative contribution sea ice antarctic typically reaches highest extent northern hemisphere arctic typically reaches highest extent northern hemisphere
reason dramatic divergence year arctic antarctic experiencing anomalously low conditions time rare
experts agree cause low sea ice hemisphere likely caused different
year especially warm terms air temperature sea reported line trend reduced sea october november typically time rapid ice gain arctic daylight hours become shorter shorter eventually whats referred polar
air temperatures zero degrees fahrenheit parts arctic ocean covered ice quickly become
air temperatures staying much closer freezing mark degrees
make matters water temperatures arctic ocean several degrees expected result less sea
less ice rays heat darker opposed deflected back space white ice
result one scientists warned
unexpected finding loss sea ice antarctica
unlike antarctic sea ice generally increasing year year past couple despite overall warming trends
nothing like due open ocean circulation around lack land factors make understanding trends difficult
finding discussed antarctic climate researchers september post antarctica also broken new climate record low winter sea
peak million square kilometres late sea ice began month ahead schedule setting daily low records
authors suggest factors may play role reduced sea including changing wind patterns warmer ocean water rising ultimately climate remains currently trying see picture pieces still
final questions debate valid present global sea ice trends hemispheres method misrepresents severity
post chart kaitlyn tiffany published statement combined easy derive online posted useful analysis tool indicator climate
looking regions ice extent trends processes separately provides insight ice extent
sea ice arctic governed somewhat different processes sea ice around different geography two plays large

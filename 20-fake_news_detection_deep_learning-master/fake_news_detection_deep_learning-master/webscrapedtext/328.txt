			A sea monster of giant size was spotted near Antarctica.							See Example( s )

On 29 April 2016, YouTube user “Wowforreal” posted a video presented as possibly showing a “massive unknown creature” near Antarctica whose existence had been confirmed via images from Google Earth:

No idea what this is but it’s circulating a few places right now and when I saw it, it IMMEDIATELY made me think of a Plesiosaur fin. Was hard to see from the images I was seeing so I went there on my own, to Google Earth. Here’s what I found and how you get there. That’s one massive disturbance in the ocean down there and who knows what really caused it. Maybe now we know the source of The Bloop! Go there on Google Earth and form your own opinion.

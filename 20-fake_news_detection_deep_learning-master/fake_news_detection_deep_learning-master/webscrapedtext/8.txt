			Police found more than 30 cow eyeballs in a man's rectum after arresting him for drunk driving.					
On 24 July 2015, the web site Crazed published an article reporting that police in Wyoming had found more than 30 cow eyeballs in a man named Roy Tilbott’s rectum after he was stopped for suspicion of DUI:
Police made a routine traffic stop early Thursday morning and got more than they bargained for when Roy Tilbott, 51, stepped out of his El Camino for a field sobriety test and Casper police noticed several eyeballs slide from his right pant leg onto the road.
Feeling they could have a potential murderer on their hands, police quickly drew guns and cuffed Tilbott.
Tilbott assured police the eyeballs were not human, but instead cow eyeballs he had pilfered from Johnson Meats (a slaughterhouse) where Tilbott is employed as a butcher.
“Company won’t let us take animal scraps home and instead toss them in the landfill,” Tilbott said in the police report. “They’re a very wasteful company. We should be allowed to take scrap meat and other parts home. The company should start a green initiative. They don’t even have recycling at the plant.”

There was no truth to the above-quoted story, which was just another piece of “satire” from a fake news web site. 
There were several telltale signs that this story was fake. First, no other major publication reported the strange story of “Roy Tilbott” and his fetish for cow eyeballs as real news. Second, the photo included in the Crazed article showed a man named James Joe Nordwall (not Roy Tilbott), a serial rapist who was sentenced to 100 years in prison in 2014. 
Finally, Crazed’s disclaimer states that all articles found on the web site are “for entertainment purposes only.”

			Melania Trump wore a "pussy-bow" blouse to the second 2016 presidential debate.							See Example( s )

After the conclusion of the second presidential debate held at Washington University in St. Louis on 9 October 2016, multiple fashionistas identified the fuchsia blouse worn by Melania Trump at that event as an $1,100 silk crepe de chine creation by the fashion giant, Gucci — a style of blouse known as a “pussy bow” (supposedly because the bow at the throat resembles ones commonly tied around cats’ necks).
And as Mashable (and others) pointed out, the choice of blouse may have been poorly-timed, given that an audio tape of Donald Trump’s talking in lewd terms about women had been leaked just days earlier:
The wardrobe selection comes only two days after a 2005 video showed Donald Trump saying, “Grab them by the pussy” when referring to women he predatorily pursued.
Melania’s choice of clothing was in all likelihood a total coincidence. (Or a soon-to-be-fired stylist is smirking somewhere.) The style is a common accoutrement on women’s blouses, and one favored by the likes of former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and legendary designer Coco Chanel.
Coincidence? Trolling IRL? You decide, America.
An online shopping page shows an identical-looking Gucci blouse selling for $1,100:
The “pussy-bow” blouse is an established style that features a loose tie at the neck of a shirt, usually made of thick material, that allows the wearer to tie it in various ways. It has been in fashion in recent years but has decades of history behind it as an item of women’s apparel.
The campaign said Ms. Trump’s choice of attire was “not intentional”:

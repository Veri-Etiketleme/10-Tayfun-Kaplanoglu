			A photograph shows a girl killed in a drunk-driving accident, with accompanying text recording her last words.							See Example( s )

Warning teens about the perils of drunk driving may be a laudable goal, but nonetheless the nightmarish “true story” scenario presented above was pure fiction.  The gruesome photograph didn’t depict a real accident of any type; rather, it was a staged accident scene established at Laguna Hills (California) High School in February 2010 as part of the Every 15 Minutes program to educate students about the dangers of drinking and texting while driving:

Life’s lessons are best learned through experience. Unfortunately, when the target audience is teens and the topic is drinking and texting while driving, experience is not the teacher of choice.
The Every 15 Minutes Program offers real-life experience without the real-life risks. This emotionally charged program, entitled Every 15 Minutes, is an event designed to dramatically instill teenagers with the potentially dangerous consequences of drinking alcohol and texting while driving. This powerful program will challenge students to think about drinking, texting while driving, personal safety, and the responsibility of making mature decisions when lives are involved.
After lunch, a simulated traffic collision will be viewable on the school grounds. Rescue workers will treat injured student participants. These students will experience first hand, the sensations of being involved in a tragic, alcohol-related and texting while driving collision. The coroner will handle fatalities on the scene, while the injured students will be extricated by the jaws-of-life manned by Fire-Fighters and Paramedics. Police Officers will investigate, arrest, and book the student “drunk driver”. Student participants will continue their experience by an actual trip to the morgue, the hospital emergency room, and to the police department jail for the purpose of being booked for “drunk driving”.

The accompanying text, which supposedly records the last utterances of the “dead” girl in the photograph, is taken from a poem (“Somebody Should Have Taught Him”) which was circulated at least as far back as the year 2000 as part of a petition against drunk driving.

			British actor Rowan Atkinson, best known as 'Mr. Bean,' has died.					
Another celebrity death hoax reared its head in July 2016, then again in March 2017, as posts circulated on Facebook sharing the news that British actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson, best known for playing the character Mr. Bean on television and in movies, was dead, having committed suicide or died in a traffic accident at age 58:


Clue #1 that the information is false: In the viral graphic, Atkinson’s birth year is given as 1995. If true, that would put him in his twenties.
Clue #2 that the information is false: In the viral graphic, Atkinson’s age is given as 58. In reality, he’s 62 (as of 2017), having been born in 1955.
Clue #3 that the information is false: Nowhere, in any legitimate media, has it been reported that Rowan Atkinson passed away.  In fact, Atkinson recently announced that he was about to become a father again at age 62:

Rowan Atkinson, the Blackadder and Mr Bean actor, is to become a father again at the age of 62, it has been reported.
The star, who has two grown up children from his first marriage, is expecting his first child with actress Louise Ford, who is 29-years his junior.
The couple have been together for three years and are said to be delighted and excited about the news.

The errors and inconsistencies in the hoax reports of his death are attributable to the fact that a virtually identical hoax has circulated before and has been repurposed, with little or no attention to detail, in 2016 and thereafter.
The most important thing to know about it is that the hoax is also a “clickjacking” scam. If you click on the blurb expecting to see a video or get more information, what you will find instead is that you have been redirected to another website that will attempt to get you to share your personal info, request access to your Facebook account, demand that you fill out a survey before proceeding, or all of the above.

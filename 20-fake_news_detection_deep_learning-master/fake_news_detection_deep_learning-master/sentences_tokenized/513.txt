mothers body later found half
seems fantastically ghastly completely whats real story behind
one bizarre true tales really
someone taken genuine old photograph unknown origin created fictitious backstory explain
someone merge real account gruesome halloween murder unrelated
picture explanation
correct answer phony mostly fake
image shown started somewhat family photograph fell hands halloween artist edward allen haunted transformed image called midwestern matricide altering original remove mothers head place axe hands always liked photograph meaning work
thought really eerie atmosphere stark desolate somber expressions family members
like many photos rather washed like
supposed look

blurred severed head give sense often see old photographs took long camera
cant easily see minimal changes really
edward also created animated gif highlighting differences original photograph creative

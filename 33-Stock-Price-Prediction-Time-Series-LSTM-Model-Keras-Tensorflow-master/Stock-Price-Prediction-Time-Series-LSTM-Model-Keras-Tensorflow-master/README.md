# Stock-Price-Prediction-Time-Series-LSTM-Model-Keras-Tensorflow
This is a model that has been trained on historical data obtained from Yahoo Finance. The data set comprises of all data records starting from the launch date of this stock in India (1996). This model aims to pick up key trends in the stock price fluctuations based on Time Series mapping. It is able to render predictions for the upcoming time period. The accuracy as obtained on the training data-set is about 90 percent and it successfully demonstrates key trends. It can be simulated on any stock in the market provided their historical data is made available. (One could use the yfinance API or download manually). Keras is used extensively along with Tensorflow for training. The model features 100 epochs of Base size 64. The training time depends on the hardware being used by the user. It is advisable to be performed on Google Colaboratory. 

Please be sure to clean the data thoroughly and strategically replace Nan/Infinite values. My advice would be to replace them with the mean of closing prices of the day preceding the day in question and the one immediately following it.

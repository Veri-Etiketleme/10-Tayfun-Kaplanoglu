# PySparkML_TextMining

The goal of this project is to use PySpark to predict spams. On this case I could use pandas, but large datasets can make things more difficult to execute some tasks and Pyspark is very powerfull for it. Even though the dataset in this example is small, I wanted to explore the possibilities and how much faster the pyspark is than others frameworks.

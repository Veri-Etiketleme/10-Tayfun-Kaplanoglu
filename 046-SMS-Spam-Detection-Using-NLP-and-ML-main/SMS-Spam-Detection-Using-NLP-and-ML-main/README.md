# SMS-Spam-Detection-Using-NLP-and-ML
- Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages.
- In this project, we will try to build a simple classifier using machine learning which will help in identifying whether a given SMS is a spam or not.

# Dataset Description
- The dataset has downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset
- The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.
- The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.

# Approach for Problem Solving
1. Understanding the Problem
2. Downloading the Dataset
3. Importing necessary Dependencies
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Data Pre-processing
6. Vectorization    
7. Building the Model
8. Evaluation of the Model
9. End Results

# End Results
- The accuracy on test data has observed about 98.56 % by using SVMs. This is a great accuracy & it means that the model does rightly calssify the SPAM and HAM messages with least possible errors.
- Surprisingly, Random Forest Classifier has less accuracy than the SVMs.

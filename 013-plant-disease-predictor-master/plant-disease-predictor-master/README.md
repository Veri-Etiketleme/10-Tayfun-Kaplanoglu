# Machine Learning Based Plant Diseases Predictor
  This application uses a trained convolutional neural network(AlexNet) to identify the disease present on a plant leaf. It consists of 38 classes of different healthy and diseased plant leaves. The 38 classes are:
  
  01. Apple-> Apple scab
  02. Apple-> Black rot
  03. Apple-> Cedar apple rust
  04. Apple-> healthy
  05. Blueberry-> healthy
  06. Cherry-> Powdery mildew
  07. Cherry-> healthy
  08. Corn-> Cercospora leaf spot (Gray leaf spot)
  09. Corn-> Common rust
  10. Corn-> Northern Leaf Blight
  11. Corn-> healthy
  12. Grape-> Black rot
  13. Grape-> Esca (Black Measles)
  14. Grape-> Leaf blight (Isariopsis Leaf Spot)
  15. Grape-> healthy
  16. Orange-> Haunglongbing (Citrus greening)
  17. Peach-> Bacterial spot
  18. Peach-> healthy
  19. Pepper, bell-> Bacterial spot
  20. Pepper, bell-> healthy
  21. Potato-> Early blight
  22. Potato-> Late blight
  23. Potato-> healthy
  24. Raspberry-> healthy
  25. Soybean-> healthy
  26. Squash-> Powdery mildew
  27. Strawberry-> Leaf scorch
  28. Strawberry-> healthy
  29. Tomato-> Bacterial spot
  30. Tomato-> Early blight
  31. Tomato-> Late blight
  32. Tomato-> Leaf Mold
  33. Tomato-> Septoria leaf spot
  34. Tomato-> Spider mites (Two-spotted spider mite)
  35. Tomato-> Target Spot
  36. Tomato-> Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
  37. Tomato-> Tomato mosaic virus
  38. Tomato-> healthy

# Steps to run the application:
**This application requires Python 3.6 or higher**

  01. Download the repository by clicking on the download button or type the following command in CMD to clone the repository:
      
      `git clone https://gitlab.com/Hafijul_ali/plant-disease-predictor.git`

  02. (Optional) Create a virtual enviourment.
    **If you create a virtual enviourment, make sure it is activated and you execute all commands from within the virtual enviournment. Skip this step if you are unsure about how it works.**

  03. Install required packages:
      
      `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  04. Navigate to `plant-disease-predictor` directory and run the application with the following command:
      
      `python app.py`

  05. Your application is running. Choose any infected image to get results.

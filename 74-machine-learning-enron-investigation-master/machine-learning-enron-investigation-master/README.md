# machine-learning-enron-investigation
ML project at Udacity to build a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal.
### poi_id.pyc
contains all code done for data analysis and iterative test of various algorithms. 
### Enron_poi_ML Algorithm.pdf
final report explaining result and conclusions at each step.  
- poi_id.pyc finally generates my_classfier.pkl and my_dataset.pkl for final training data and best classifier. tester.pyc can be used to run final classifier to predict ML algorithm score.

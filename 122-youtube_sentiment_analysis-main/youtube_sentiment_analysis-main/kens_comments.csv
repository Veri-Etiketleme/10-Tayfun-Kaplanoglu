I'm doing research now that my professor plans to get published, but it took a lot of work to get to this spot. I don't know of any other master's student in my program doing research. Tina's right that generally, those opportunities are only available for undergrads and PhD students. I want to do an independent study in reinforcement learning to close out my last semester (next semester) but I already know that since I'm not a PhD student or curious undergrad, the chances of me getting that opportunity are slim to none. I'm hopeful that instead I might just continue to do research under the professor I'm currently working with. Course based masters definitely can be good, but it's also good to be aware of the possible cons that they can come with, and I think this video does a good job of explaining those pros and cons.

73,"Hi Ken, while watching this video, I just realized that I'm now part of one data science community. Wow, thank you for bringing us all together! I'm looking forward to more of your videos about Kaggle projects. 

Lately, I found one very useful extension of jupyter notebook, TOC2, which automatically creates a table of contents with hyperlinks based on the headings. Its link: https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/toc2/README.html. Once you try it, I bet you will love it.

However, it's not available in Kaggle yet. The closest thing it has is to display the first level headings on the right in the reading mode. There's large room for improvement.

Louis posted in product feedback on Kaggle six months ago (https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/153519), but received little attention. What a pity! Can you help draw more attention and upvote it? If you have any other ideas, please let me know. I strongly believe that getting our sharing notebook well organized and more readable is very helpful for the community.

I beleive that was the best path for me to take since I want to start out as a Data Scientist and eventually scale over to Product Management. This program basically teaches me both skills. However, I've noticed that there are a lot of MS CS and MS DS majors who apply for these majors. Do you think I should change my major to match those or do you think I should remain in the track that I am. I still believe once I am done with the program, I'll have the same skillset as the other majors, I just don't want to get screened out of getting a chance to be interviewed.",Ugy2w2Ww53V_ISmQ06h4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_KPHaRWETPBc-ELkO3H2Yg,Stanley Olisaemeka Afonta,2,1,2020-11-16 22:57:33+00:00,DM1eE_Coh6g,2,Avoid These Data Science Resume Mistakes!,2020-11-16

I was going to learn it through some paid resources but little did I know that posting everyday would open doors to have recruiters talk with me. I got to speak with recruiters from Amazon, Facebook, and a consultancy group. I have now pivoted to Computer Vision as the niche I want to focus on.

I am a SE with 1 year of experience, I am learning ML/DS since around 6 months and recently I talked to the management of my company for transition to data science. 
They referred me to some research papers related to the respected domain which had seriously complicated math (look at it https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225708015_Impact_on_inventory_costs_with_consolidation_of_distribution_centers).

I am really overwhelmed with all this and am kind of scared by looking at the same.

147,"I joined the initiative and lasted maybe 10 days... This year has been really rough, but I've always had a problem finding the motivation to self-teach. My personal lesson that I learned was to take the ""5 mins a day"" to heart. My flawed plan at the beginning was to spend 2-3 hours everyday watching recordings of a bootcamp course I took to refresh my memory on coding, then dive into projects. I got burnt out super fast, and part of that was because I wanted to match the impressive strides I saw so many people making on Discord. I'll definitely pace myself better next time and not be stingy and actually buy an online course.

156,"Oh man! What an excellent and beautiful video! I have learned so much these past few months, become so much better, it blows my mind. And it wasn't just Machine learning either. That being said, being part of the #66daysofdata community has certainly been a very large contributor to this, so many thanks for the opportunity ! :)

And one thing that I found that helps for ... practically everything is something that I learned while watching a very old movie named the ""Silent Flute"".
The script was originally written by none other than Bruce Lee who died before he could shoot it. It was taken over and the 'master' was played by none other than David Carradine. And despite showing its old age,  it's full of wisdoms! 

One of them in particular struck a major cord inside me when David Carradine, playing the master who, according to his student, ""seemed to know everything"" he simply answered with this:

""Every time the sun rises, like the student on their first day of school, I open a blank page in my mind to write the lesson of the day."" ... After which, I wrote this on a blank page and added ""... and have an actual, real blank page ready to write the lesson on it.""

I started this on the 14th of may and ... well ... still doing this every-single-day. It's incredible how much you can learn about ... everything when doing this little exercise and I certainly do like to mention Machine Learning here and there. Like, say, pointing out the importance of iterations in practically everything you can do and learn in life. 

Or use lessons I learned from something else, say art, and apply them to my Machine Learning studies -> The kind that says sometimes it's good to switch to something different. not only does it allows you to go back later with a fresh mind but, even better, for all you know, the other project you'll be working might give you ideas for the first one. 

Just watching this video is bringing back to memory some of the stuff that I have written in this 'book of wisdom' of mine and makes me want to say so many things about it that I won't do it. This post is already getting very long as it is, sorry for the wall of text.  ( come to think of it, I need to write one on how to try to summarize my point of views much more briefly).

199,"You're really starting to get the hang of this YouTube(r) business down! The editing is looking great with the different camera angles and transitions and stuff. Have you considered streaming on Twitch or YouTube for some extra views/content? Resume reviews, portfolio reviews, interview advice/practice, teaching something, etc? I know you put out that course a while ago. Good content in the video by the way. I've been using Kaggle to learn some proper ML techniques and their implementations along with when/how to use them,  and also get acquainted with Python more since I'm an such an R junkie. Playing with some stock data sets on there has been good for me, but I do agree, value or good business value comes from gathering some original data or doing something with some impact. 

I'm currently thinking about trying to build a special app/thingy (currently thinking an RShiny web app) that scrapes data/information on Yugioh's card collecting/valuation website and then so someone can enter what cards they have and how much (ignoring PSA value) and then it'll autopopulate the current valuation cell next to it or something. One small note, and I hope this doesn't come across as offensive, but I personally thought that the camera angle/cutaway/transition at around @6:45 was a bit awkward, as it looked like you were speaking but there was an audio lag or something. Very well could just be something due to my internet, but it took me out a little bit if you know what I mean. Nonetheless though, great video and great content.

237,"In my opinion, you should stick to the field you are interested in. And data should be complicated enough to be worth analyzing, not like two columns. But to get both the data and the idea is the biggest problem for me so far. I either have the idea, but it's nearly impossible to find any decent amount of data or there would be lots of data, but on a topic that I've never found the least exciting. Sometimes data isn't complicated enough for a project. For instance, I do monitor used cars sales on a regular basis, I just love reading about cars, comparing them. But the tricky thing is, there are like 5 or 6 variables to utilize, like mileage, color, horsepower, year produced etc. It's more than enough for eda, but there is not much room for machine learning project. The only interesting idea I came up with (apart fromobvious linear regression) is to analyze, whether mileage is real or not based on the price, number of owners etc. It seems like some fields are inferior in terms of generating data, than others",Ugwec0TyabkXgwV1e7F4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdlkZO58Gl-uOfLjmeSS7gQ,–ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º –ë–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ–≤,1,1,2020-11-06 16:12:31+00:00,yUrrf3Pm33s,1,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,2020-11-06

The other option is for my son to finish his current B.A. in PHHP at the University of Florida and move forward to the Post Baccalaureate degree to get the additional credits needed. He would then move on to the B.A. in  C.S. and finish that degree. One is longer and a Public University the other is Private, but I belive  he can obtain what he needs in Maryville. This is the trade off and frankly he hates the PHHP bachelor's and has 3 more semesters and I would like him to just move on. One is more time, One is more money.

I'm a Masters in business, currently working as a Sr. Data/Business analyst for a supply chain company. I've recently changed my path from being a mechanical engineer who worked in the green energy field. I've always been fascinated by code and have quite some background in C++, I've taken some basic courses in python and have been doing a ton of exercises.

I'm thinking of progressing to a PM role in the future with the help of some DS certifications. Is there any career path advice you can help me with? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

401,"Hi, great video, some tips for the reader from what I learned from work: 
1. I recommend to start including git in every project you do, I didn‚Äôt do that, but I wish i did. It helps like ken said with version control, and easier changes publishing instead of going online and going through a whole process, and also ur gonna use it at work for sure so might as well practice.
2. He‚Äôs using GitBash, idk if it was mentioned and I missed it but that‚Äôs the command line interface to use git. It‚Äôs also good cause it uses Bash so if u know Linux/Ubuntu it‚Äôs be easier to use. I use the same but there are others if you don‚Äôt want to start with a command line like VsCode, Atom, GitHub Desktop (although I recommend Bash). 
3. use Git Status pretty much after every command because If ur in ur own branch, and want to switch to another one, all your work will be lost if not committed or stashed first. 
(Git Stash is just what it sounds like, temporarily stashed or saves your changes to the side so u can do other work and then Pop later).",UgwTSYNgmCTE_t0h9yx4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4CiwFWd0GY9gr_fkZYYTRg,Ray Ojel,1,1,2020-10-24 12:45:53+00:00,_0rHU6qAQe0,1,git for Data Science Made Simple...

530,"""We fail more then we success""  - so Data Science is like real Science... In Academia you only have high success to failure rate at low levels. Once you get to new and complex things it can get hard. Really hard. And depressing. Of course you can always be that lucky one and get your experiment parameters right in first go. ;) 

I used to be what a lot of people would think of as a ""real scientist"" (the one that does experiments in a lab coat, in a lab to discover and create new things). A lot of things in Academia is presented as if the success was effortless, nobody is showing the amount of work that went into it, results from failed experiments rarely get published if at all.

One of my friends also has imposter syndrome (I have different issues ;) I am always hungry for knowledge and new things and I love solving problems; also I'm unemployed atm so I can't have an imposter syndrome)...

As for failures - this is a normal part of the process. I don't remember who said it, but it went like this: when you enter the a new uncharted territory, when you try new things nobody did before, everybody is underqualified for the job. I think this is a huge part of what being a Scientist is - you try to do new things, and you fail, and you learn from it and you try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Some problems can't get solved at this stage - maybe new tools, theories, new data need to appear first. Sometimes it is too expensive to do what is needed to get a good solution, maybe an approximation can be good enough? I'd like to say that this is why you get paid the big bucks - because it requires certain way of thinking, intelligence and skills to solve problems. To be a Scientist it ain't an easy job in general. Sadly a lot of Scientists are really poorly payed. And a lot of research is conducted in a very bad, unproductive way, but that's an off-topic.

The job hunt - IMO it is a bit of lottery. And just because someone has amazing credentials doesn't necessarily mean they are amazing themselves. I've worked with people that had PhDs from an university ranked in world's top 25, one of these people came even from a VERY VERY good research group... and they were not living up to the standard I imagined. The best Scientists I worked with came from UK (university outside the country's top 10) and India. Of course good credentials do help you to get a job. That's why you should get them. But also get the understanding of the things you are doing and the knowledge of the subject. A PhD diploma is a proof a person wrote and defended a PhD, it does not make someone a good Scientist. Maybe it should, but these are two different things.

I also heard words of wisdom that went like these: don't compare yourself to other people, you don't know their full story. Compare the you of yesterday to the you of today.

I'm off with that - this comment is getting too long. Good video Ken :)",UgwM0jjh6kHvyYrF7bh4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwuJkG2IxMrvSSCu0LWsiTg,hAgg,2,4,2020-10-16 19:53:58+00:00,Uf0dO-pgOrk,2,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),2020-10-16

537,letterly this is what I feel almost in every competitive environment I engage in. Some times I have objective evidence that I am worse than most people  like in sport when no one picks me to play in their team. And sometimes in the contrary I think I'm bad but when I see other people's performance I know that I'm not. I think that is because we fail to something called survivorship bias. Most of the people that we see are successful since successful people have more popularity so the sample of people that we are comparing ourselves with is not random.,UgxiQZxHmgRnpVCKp6R4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLQs_R60GxtQ1GbPLCD86hQ,ÿ¨ÿßÿ®ÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿáÿ±ŸàÿØŸä,1,1,2020-10-16 18:00:01+00:00,Uf0dO-pgOrk,1,Dealing with Doubt in Data Science (My Impostor Syndrome Story),2020-10-16

544,"I really liked how he talked about learning to like this feeling. I think a physical training metaphor here is really apt. When you work out it hurts and is uncomfortable as you train muscles you may not be using very often. One thing many people who work out regularly talk about is how good they feel afterwards, even though their body is in pain. Similarly whenever you learn something it hurts, almost phyically. You can feel your mind straining to try and understand whatever abstract concept your reading about. For some reason we are surpised by this. ""Shouldn't this be easier?"", ""How does anyone understand this"", or ""The guy in the video I watch made it seem like this was easy to understand"". of course we do not see how long they had to sturggle to actually understand the concept. If we go in with the expectiation, this going to hurt but I love that feeling of brain ache after a good reading I think it can help with those feelings a lot.

563,"Hi ken, loved the content you have been putting out regarding DS, I have some doubts regarding my situation since its quite specific and I wanted to get your opinion.

I was going to start my undergrad as an Engineer in Data and Mathematics but I have decided to wait one more year so that I can study in Germany (I live in Mexico so returning here with with a German title will allow me to secure a job with ease). In the mean time I have been considering possibly switching majors to something like Economics, or Physics. I have thought of becoming a DS for two years now, however I am worried that the Job opportunities DS promises might shrink and that my degree might limit me the amount of jobs I can find in comparison to the other degrees I am interested in. I am not the best at coding however I have been told that as long as I know how to properly query with SQL (which I can) and have a good exposition of my data, I should be fine. Although I know I would enjoy my time studying something like Economics I feel like it would be really easy for me and I would only want to get in degree in something I struggle with so that I have a more complete profile when I enter the corporate world.

TLDR: I really enjoy the implications of being a DS and want a challenging major, but I don't know if Im cut out to be one and might consider just doing a Masters after an undegrad in something else.",Ugw12KDJ1My-8T0vPHF4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyrruQG8coa3HFpFR_EU5QQ,Alejandro Morales,1,2,2020-10-16 02:52:09+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,1,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,2020-10-16

I've got a physics work background with no degree. I'm looking to go back to school for a masters in physics in mind, but interested in combined/joint degree options. I'm leaning towards mathematics, but with the priority of CS towards Data Science, I might consider the later. Would a bootcamp be enough as long as I do my own projects and networking to keep DS an option, or would you strongly recommend the Phys/CS joint degree over the combined phys/math -> masters -> bootcamp option.

631,"Agreed, there is no replacement for real world projects.   When tutorials are designed, they will always come to a successful model with good results and will usually have the data nicely prepared for you.  That's exactly opposite of the real world.  You may work on a project for weeks and conclude there is no signal in the data at least in its current form, or you may work weeks on just preparing data or learning enough domain knowledge to understand the data.  That said tutorials and class learning are great to learn the workflow and structure of analysis. As you said you will be constantly going back and forth between direct coding and learning new methods to tackle new problems.  I would say if you have an idea of the domain you will be working in, you should focus your efforts on the models and concepts relevant to that domain.  There isn't a whole lot of similarity between analyzing mass scientific tabular data and computer vision.",Ugx-1m56ldMonejk9Fh4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU2VdzEZwWMwxZKdthm4uRA,LeftThumbBreak,1,1,2020-10-11 14:27:06+00:00,4OZip0cgOho,1,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),2020-10-11

655,Great video! You should have mentioned RShiny/Shiny apps in your second (third?) bullet point though! But I'm heavily partial/biased towards R haha. Great vid. I like the idea of doing a project involving web scraping. The one thing that can be frustrating about being in grad school for stats is all of our data sets are already cleaned for us. We just get it and most of the time it's all good to go so we can just worry about doing whatever statistics we need to do on it. Scraping data sounds like a good way to get some nice raw data that would require some cleaning and then running some cool analytics on after some EDA.

678,"Hey Ken, your down-to-basics and straightforward approach to the explaining data science and learning it are very confidence-inspiring to someone trying to get into the field. I have a background somewhat in statistics in that I graduated with an undergrad in psychology but with a focus on statistics. I did 3 quantitative and 1 qualitative study in undergrad and I think I have some chance of using that to my advantage. I'm working currently to pay the bills and keep needs like health insurance available and I'm currently starting the self-study method. I've binged through a few videos and I'm going to try ""ultralearning"" data science, but I'm really not sure where to go from there. I'm going to try to build a good portfolio but I feel like if I just try to say"" I have a degree in psych buut it's with a focus on psych stats"" and then get just a cert or a bootcamp then it won't be worth it for anybody looking to hire. Getting a masters is always on the table but like you said that's a big time and money commitment for no guarantee of a career out of the gate. In the end I think the connections of a bootcamp are more beneficial for me but I also don't want to shell out cash to find out that method would not make me look as good on a resume compared to a degree program.

687,You know what I hate about modern day sports analytics? You got all these terms that never existed like 10 or so years ago in sports with strange names that are hard to figure out what they even mean. Yet people continuously write articles referencing them as if the average sports fan already knows what all these are and they're self explanatory even though they clearly aren't and it's fancy jargon that you have no clue what it could possibly mean. Like I was reading an article talking about Breonna Stewarts win shares in her WNBA career. Nowhere in the article did it explain what win shares mean. Obviously it has to do with wins. But beyond that I have no clue. Then there is this other one that has defense or defensive in the title I can remember the full name of the stat but it's a really strange name. It's mentioned all the time as if it's common sense to what it means and we should already know. Lol. Nobody ever explains these things as if they're normal stats.

692,"Hey Ken, I am in the process of changing my major from a B.S. in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) to Data Science as the ROI (Return on Investment) is sub par in SLP and I have discovered many interesting facets associated with Data Science. I have to take some prereqs before I can apply to my university's B.S. in Data Science program. However, I became concerned as you mentioned that Data Science COULD become oversaturated even if I have a Master's degree (SLP is too since they'll take anyone ranging from pre-med to Underwater Basket Weaving). Will I keep a high-paying job if I make this transition now and have a few years of experience after earning a grad degree, or should I do the following: 1) B.S. in Data Science with Actuarial Science Minor 2) B.A. or B.S. in Stats with a Minor in Computer Science 3) Pick something in tech, business, econ/finance, or another field. After learning from the recent pandemic and reevaluating my college career, I have surmised that I want to do a tech, math, computer, business, or finance/econ-based job from home.

704,"Hi Ken, tell me what you think of my idea.
Given my age and current educational background and the fact that we are in a pandemic and many companies are probably mitigating risks in regards to hiring, trying to find myself an entry-level data analyst job will probably be next to impossible. I have decided that I am going to be starting a master's program this fall. I am deciding on Colorado State University Global's AI and Machine Learning master's degree or going with Eastern University's Master's in Data Science. Eastern's  program is brand new, so it probably does not have many reviews yet. It seem like it is a program for all ability levels, so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program. I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field. I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year, but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school. I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least 2023. With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs, I feel it is going to get super competitive. With the rock bottom tuition for some of these programs helping to minimize student loan debt, I might as well use this time to rack up a master's degree or two in this field.",UgxGf4S_CP7uGxdpFEd4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VGE_oMmD3qzI9yEco0I1w,Downhill D Miller,1,1,2020-10-07 01:06:57+00:00,UpaEjBOMNqs,1,5 Proven Strategies to Break into a Data Science Job,2020-10-07

733,"Hi Ken,

I hope you are doing well . I have to muster up a lot of courage to write this knowing the reality could be bitter . I work in a large tech firm , I have CS degree from a reputed university. I joined this firm as Oracle DBA  , hoping I will get a chance to transition to developer role at some point. As this was my first job , I asked the manager and HR's to help me with this transition , but because I turned out to be a very good DBA they simply didn't allow me to move to other roles that were available inside organization. I have already spent 5 years in this role and have received 4 promotions so I am more or less viewed as a Senior DBA and I absolutely hate to call myself DBA. My earnings are very good but I have 0 job satisfaction. I have stronger than average python skills , I hold multiple AWS certs and have also worked in UI frameworks such as Angular. 
Now I really don't wanna join another firm as a Senior DBA therefore I applied several entry level jobs for which I received no calls (which is what I was expecting to be honest). I am in a phase where I feel as what if I finish learning Data Science will it be worth it , or am I making a wrong decision. Have you ever seen anyone transitioning from DBA role to Data Scientist ?  So basically what I am most anxious about is once all is said and done will I ever be hired in Data Scientist role. I am really passionate about pursuing Data Science but afraid if all my efforts go in vain. Also , throughout these five years I haven't spent a day not coding , it was very difficult as DBA's usually work round the clock. I am painfully introvert which makes me even more sad that I can't advertise my skills , have no friends even though I have fantastic communication skills . I have to attend  regular meetings with the client and give presentations I don't face any issues in business meetings but when it comes to showcase my interpersonal skills I absolutely suck. I hope if you read this you wont get annoyed, I couldn't tell the mess I am in right now to anyone . I just want some guidance from you about my situation.

793,"Ive worked in Data Science for three years now. When you go to that interview my best advice is to be studied up and give good examples of practical experience. It is quite rewarding I went from 58k starting now at 72K three years I pay 0 dollars and 0 cents for health care that is a Cadillac Plan I get 10 sick days a year and 3 weeks Vacation Time. I do not pay for food when I am at work they cater in meals. Heres some personal advice to prepare yourself. Kick all bullshit people and situations out of your life. This includes All Social Media you need to focus and be prepared. You need to really be strong in systems and troubleshooting skills of those systems. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PHONE IN THE INTERVIEW. TAKE A NOTEPAD AND HAVE YOUR OWN PEN SUGGEST A FISHER SPACE PEN IT WILL WRITE AND NOT MAKE YOU BE IN A PEN BEGGING SITUATION>. My interview was five people that you need to convince you are worth a shit.  I do remember a remarkable moment in the interview where I was asked about Social Media I stated that I had closed all my Social Media Years prior. 

These systems are complex and use many inter relationship application features to communicate data  to one another. You need to be able to show this understanding. You need to be able to find and isolate issues in that system. You need to be able to answer questions about particular data points and features. This is not for everybody. I'm just going to lay it all out here if you fuck off at  work and arent truly focused dont apply. If you are the type of person who just wants a check who thinks showing up is good enough dont apply. This is why they have so many people at the interviews for these jobs. They are trying to see if you have what it takes and are disciplined. I used number four applied with in the company. Yes they paid for the training after selection. By the way the criteria was stiff 90% weighted grades required or you would be let go. There was 19 people in the class 15 made it.

When I was hired 5 people were hired at the same time 4 of those have been fired. Theres good money to be made here if you show you are serious they will keep raising your pay. Reasons for firing one was on FaceBook all the time. One was a Narcissitic Drama Queen. One had tons of excuses for not completing Tasks. One got fired for Sexual Harrassment.

What would you advise a person like me? 

I was thinking about getting a bunch of certificates - those offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera seem to be ok (as opposed to IBM Data Science course - this one sucks), also Coursera has several courses organized by Google, AWS, Mongo DB, etc that seem interesting, as they prove presence of some practical skills in real industry used tools. 

What do you think is the better option - bootcamp or a collection of certificates?

812,"How Much Math do I need in Data Science?
Math skills are essential in data science and machine learning
 
I. Introduction

If you are a data science aspirant, you no doubt have the following questions in mind:

Can I become a data scientist with little or no math background?

What essential math skills are important in data science?

There are so many good packages that can be used for building predictive models or for producing data visualizations. Some of the most common packages for descriptive and predictive analytics include:

    Ggplot2
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Scikit-learn
    Caret
    TensorFlow
    PyTorch
    Keras

Thanks to these packages, anyone can build a model or produce a data visualization. However, very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine-tuning your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance. It is one thing to build a model, it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out meaningful conclusions that can be used for data-driven decision making. It‚Äôs important that before using these packages, you have an understanding of the mathematical basis of each, that way you are not using these packages simply as black-box tools.
II. Case Study: Building A Multiple Regression Model

Let‚Äôs suppose we are going to be building a multi-regression model. Before doing that, we need to ask ourselves the following questions:

How big is my dataset?

What are my feature variables and target variable?

What predictor features correlate the most with the target variable?

What features are important?

Should I scale my features?

How should my dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets?

What is principal component analysis (PCA)?

Should I use PCA for removing redundant features?

How do I evaluate my model? Should I used R2 score, MSE, or MAE?

How can I improve the predictive power of the model?

Should I use regularized regression models?

What are the regression coefficients?

What is the intercept?

Should I use non-parametric regression models such as KNeighbors regression or support vector regression?

What are the hyperparameters in my model, and how can they be fine-tuned to obtain the model with optimal performance?

Without a sound math background, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to address the questions raised above. The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning, mathematical skills are as important as programming skills. As a data science aspirant, it is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning. Your ability to build reliable and efficient models that can be applied to real-world problems depends on how good your mathematical skills are. To see how math skills are applied in building a machine learning regression model, please see this article: Machine Learning Process Tutorial.

Let‚Äôs now discuss some of the essential math skills needed in data science and machine learning.
III. Essential Math Skills for Data Science and Machine Learning
1. Statistics and Probability

Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard deviation/variance, Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix, Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal), p-value, Baye‚Äôs Theorem (Precision, Recall, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve), Central Limit Theorem, R_2 score, Mean Square Error (MSE), A/B Testing, Monte Carlo Simulation
2. Multivariable Calculus

Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors. Hence, familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Functions of several variables; Derivatives and gradients; Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function; Cost function; Plotting of functions; Minimum and Maximum values of a function
3. Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A data set is represented as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Vectors; Norm of a vector; Matrices; Transpose of a matrix; The inverse of a matrix; The determinant of a matrix; Trace of a Matrix; Dot product; Eigenvalues; Eigenvectors
4. Optimization Methods

Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Cost function/Objective function; Likelihood function; Error function; Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm)
IV. Summary and Conclusion

In summary, we‚Äôve discussed the essential math and theoretical skills that are needed in data science and machine learning. There are several free online courses that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and machine learning. As a data science aspirant, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient and reliable models. You should, therefore, invest enough time to study the mathematical theory behind each machine learning algorithm.",Ugzochg_g7ApIOrmjvF4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMZqXdiK3CYKzsX75uQ5azw,Hasnain Ajmal,0,2,2020-10-02 17:54:31+00:00,UpaEjBOMNqs,0,5 Proven Strategies to Break into a Data Science Job,2020-10-02

I would be very interested to see how something  like that (moving the 3 point line back) would effect the way defensive schemes are designed and how it would change the game as a whole.

I was doing a bunch of research on turning one of my models into a productionized web app and I was trying to decide between AWS and Heroku. Heroku is definitely way easier and way more hands off but would it look better from a hiring managers perspective if I took the time to learn some devops and fired up an AWS instance with my model running on it?

1023,"Hi Ken,  Many thanks for your interesting and insightful sharing! I 'm from China, and have been following you on youtube. I worked for 3 Fortune-500 companies (European, American) in different roles (research, application, marketing) in the manufacturing industry in the past ten years. I like learning and  taking challenges.
My current challege is to redirect my career development into data science field to keep up with intelligent era. I hope to master the big-data-analysis skill and apply it to the digital transformation of manufacturing industry. I started learning machine learning and data analysis respectively 2~3 years ago, and took several on-line courses on Udacity, Coursera, DataCamp. I'm major in material science and engineering, much different from CS , mathematcs or statistics. There's so much to pick up! Everytime I feel like learning more, I soon found out much more to learn. It's quite overwhelming...
Your sharing helped me know better about the world of data science. As you advised, I'm now working on the Kaggle competition. Even though, the course I took before had several projects based on the Kaggle datasets and competition, it's my first time to participate in on my own. Besides, this week, I started uploading my work to github and Kaggle to build up my profile.",UgywzupDeMH_uO4GMfp4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCio7gkoQZ0kccSpfjNHhFMg,Brenda li,2,1,2020-09-26 08:01:00+00:00,Kq9dkZu0bpg,2,"Hedge Funds, Startups, and Data Science Oh my!

But does that look bad to a future employer? Like I was too lazy to create my own portfolio from scratch?

1073,"Hey Ken I've got a question for you related to projects and stuff you look for on a entry level data scientists resume/portfolio. I'm trying to decide what I should do for my next project and I'm unsure what will look better on my resume. 

Project A - Kaggle: 
- finish top 10% in a Kaggle competition and write a blog post outlining each step of the process and explaining my thought process of why I chose certain algorithms and my understanding of certain concepts 

Project B - solve a cool problem or answer a question with data science: 
-Pull data from an API database to get experience with SQL or collect my own data source through scraping 
-Clean the data 
-Do some advanced feature engineering with the data 
-Do some testing on different models to figure out which one performs the best 
-Create a website and put the end model into production 
-write a blog post about the project and its results   

Would love to hear your thoughts on this and if you value placing well on Kaggle more than a personal project that solves an interesting question.

As a beginner, I'm going through lots of books and tutorials to comprehend the concepts of each algorithm and how to apply them, basically using them in a project.
Many of the suggested projects for newbies have been done and posted by thousands of people, including bootcamp projects. Even if I do everything on my own thoroughly, it's still the same dataset, project, and approach.

1205,Hello ken. I am a full stack developer and high school student in 12 grade. I have a sound knowledge in this field. I want to be a data scientist. And in front of me there are two options. One is: Go to college and take computer science then learn data science . 2nd one is : Don't go to college and do self study and projects and take some online certificates as data scientist and machine learning engineer and I am ready to give the efforts .But I am kind of confused . Sometime I think I should do self study and real life projects but It also concern be whether it will be a good decision not to go to college. Can you kindly give a advice which will be better because you have a masters degree in computer science.

1249,"""Narrowing the scope of things I am trying to learn"" is great advise...another great video !

I learned this the hard way after spending months jumping on to follow every tutorial related to data science I could find on youtube - statistics, data analysis, data visualization, deep learning...etc. It was very overwhelming and didn't do much for my confidence as a beginner.

 I think it was one of Krish Naik's video called ""How To Learn Data Science Smartly?"" that saved me where he explains why we shouldn't try  to learn each aspect of data science separately, but rather find some data science projects and learn different topics with context by reverse engineering.",UgynC9gwrvQbArd9S-Z4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8a8Q5gpj37NFCmstwFY08g,Samir Zaheer,1,4,2020-09-11 19:20:11+00:00,jf3j0lWmFPU,1,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,2020-09-11

1251,"It is awesome and very motivating to see how you evolved so drastically!
Thank you a lot for sharing this;
about three years ago I also was mostly unproductive and did not get a lot of stuff done.
I have been continually trying to make small improvements and I have gotten a long way (but I still have an even longer way to go, of course!)

I really paused for a moment when you talked about the aspect of focus. I have been guilty in the past of trying to do 20 different things at the same time and as a result I have experienced dissatisfaction with the outcomes. I will try to narrow my goals down in the future and only focus on one (or very few) different things at a time.

When you said, that you don't think you have come far, I wanted to add one detail. I don't remember exactly where I have this ""way of thinking"" from, but it was very inspiring to me.
Even if you (as in ""you"" personally) do not feel that you have achieved ""that"" much, it can be motivating to think of people as a network in general. When someone focuses on their own success, they might see that they have done ""average"" or ""somewhat well"", but maybe their actions have affected someone else. And that person affects someone else (else). So while I know the feeling of always trying to achieve more and always wanting to be as successful as possible, I can definitely say that through your channel you have reached a lot of people. And maybe you have influenced 1% or 5% or even more of those people to do something. And maybe those 5% have influenced their own 5% and so on. 
I know for a fact that you have influenced me for the better and motivated me to start actively trying 66daysofdata and becoming more interested in habit building. So I wanted to say thank you, from me, and for everyone else you influenced at least a little bit. You're awesome! :)",UgzE2QT3VZIdeBME-bx4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXOdh3pTBBovDXzkUkTuvKA,Boris Giba,3,1,2020-09-11 18:55:47+00:00,jf3j0lWmFPU,3,The 5 Pillars of Success I Live By,2020-09-11

1254,"I swear some of the things you said reminded of some of the books you mention:

1. the importance of habits and 2. identity -> Those two go hand in hand together and, one best way to describe oneself is by what we do on a consistant basis. Hence if you can chance your habits, you can chance your identity. 
The growth mindset has been cited in many different book tough I have ""7 habits of highly successful people"". 

Motivation clearly sucks as a base strategy, since it's volatile. Don't get me wrong, it's good to have sometimes, but view it rather as a very good friend who has MANY friends, always willing to help, giving a lot of it when it can ... but who can't really always be there on account of having so many people to help .... Motivation is VERY popular these days if you catch my meaning ;)

Another thing about identity and accounting, and something I've talked about before, is to give yourself proof of what you've accomplished so far and what you are doing right now ... and a bullet journal, for this and feedback (since ppl won't always be there to give it to you) ... this is perfect for this. Make sure to add the proper tracker to it.

And when you feel one of those tracker, that's what Ken Jee here said about about fist pumping and being proud of yourself ... yep, it's very to do that with a tracker and a bullet journal. I can't tell you how many ""YES!!"" I've shouted when marking one ;)

PS:
#66daysofdata
If you watch that video with the intent of applying the advice here to your #66daysofdata ... you might be doing more than 66 of them, and good days they might be just saying ;) (I assume this should count for your challenge in that case). :)

I am a .NET MVC Full stack developer with 5 years of exp, but I am really fascinated with the concepts of NLP and CV. I set forth on my learning journey 2 months ago, using MOOCs to have a fair idea of ML. Now I have basic background into different models, plotting, EDA etc. and Python. Should I first perfect ML before moving to NLP, or should I change career into ML and then continue to pursue NLP? How should I set a timeline around this?

1360,"Hi Ken. I'm looking to transition into data science over the course of the next year or two if possible. I have around 8 years experience in digital media, so there is somewhat of a narrative of ""data analysis"" that I can build on - though that analysis was limited to digital media analytics platforms. The job has given me an edge in terms of communication, presentation-building, etc., but that's where my advantages end. My undergrad is in a non-quantitative major (sport management). I have zero calculus at this time. I spent the first 3 years of my career in sales. And I cannot afford to take an internship at any point throughout the remainder of my career.

I'm currently taking the Data Analysis nanodegree program with Udacity, and getting a really good handle on the analytics toolkit. The programming is coming easier than I expected. From there I was thinking of self-studying the math, and doing the Udacity Data Science nanodegree to start to get the DS foundation. I think I have a reasonable shot of moving into the analytics department at my current agency within the next year. I can start to build a DS portfolio around that time as well. 

With that context - do you suggest I go masters, boot camp, certificate, or continued self-study after that?",UgxxhooQMt-kUl7iuWF4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClZcooh6GqAVrIhjBU6r2bw,Steve Geick,1,1,2020-09-06 16:56:55+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,1,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,2020-09-06

I have found some frustration from ""not understanding a topic"" but not looking for a different explanation.

I still didn't understand and felt doomed to never understand p-values. Using your approach of looking for more resources, I was able to get a better understanding of it! It is a great idea to see a topic explained in different ways and by different sources. Thank you for bringing this technique up!

1408,"I am just a beginner and not an expert, but I think beginners should take the first notebook(by Pedro Marcelino) with a pinch of salt. There are some things I found very wrong in this notebook:

1. You don't always need to drop multicollinear variables. 1 most widely used model in Kaggle is XGBoost and it is immune to multicollinearity. I think, so are other random forest like models.
2. Dropping a variable because it has more than 15% missing data is a bad idea. This threshold is too much in my humble opinion.

There are more things which much more experience Data Scientists have pointed out in comments section.

I am not saying it's entirely useless but it is not great to follow it 100%. It has maximum votes but maybe it's just an outliar in Kaggle's dataset of Notebooks.",UgxSzKYopfgTtKbIh9B4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4SQi7Ro3tca-5Lq3U82O_A,xordux,1,2,2020-09-04 17:39:45+00:00,-pdXWmj9xxU,1,How I Learn Data Science Through Studying Other People's Code | #66DaysOfData,2020-09-04

1417,"Great video Ken! Learning from other people's code is a great way to learn. Another great way to learn for me is code reviewing where for example some of my colleague or students would send over their code as a Jupyter notebook where I would go over the code, figure out how the ML model workflow could be improved, could be faster, could add some areas of novelty, etc. such that the resulting research paper would have a chance for publication in a scientific journal. Afterwards, I would have discussion with the person who wrote the code and together we can learn from one another on the rationale for choosing a specific approach and whether some component could be adjusted to provide better performance, new areas of novelty, etc. 
On another note, Amazing video editing (pattern interrupts üòÉ), also noticed that you're using Notion as placeholders for the code, great tips!

I also understand how to develop algorithms with my knowledge in C and C++ (unfortunately this was over 10 yrs ago), I have maintained the knowledge to develop algorithms, not so much the language. I was taught to visual the problem and find what are constants and what will be the variables. I had also used Matlab in college to write a code to solve triple integrals...which was far easier to do than solving it by hand. I also understand statistics and have  13 years of engineering experience. I have decided to start with learning Python. I am going the self taught method.

1493,"Good luck!  I was a data scientist before it was even a job title. So I didn't start with a plan at all, but here's how  it sort of just happened...
1.BS Math (loved linear algebra) Taught school for a few years.  Ugh.
2.MS Statistics w/ 2nd concentration in Information Systems Mgmt (multivariate & time series analysis, machine learning &  database theory)
3.Entry level Tech support and QA analyst for a popular and pricey stats software. (Mastered SAS, SPSS, R, APL - similar to Numpy, learned to program & design test cases for statistical & graphics routines)
4.Mortgage data analyst at Fannie Mae. (Mostly SAS, preparing presentations for execs.) Kind of boring except for learning SAS, so I quit after 6 mos.  By then it was very easy to change jobs with the skills and network of colleagues I had amassed.
5.Software Engineer, NASA think tank.  Awesome job, rocket science!  Brilliant mentors!  UNIX!
6. Statistician, IRS IT Dept.  (Mastered Excel & Oracle Sql)
Later mastered MS SQL, Crystal Reports & Power BI for independent consulting contracts.  Yay, no more jobs!!  And I never accepted a management position because I prefer numbers to people :)
Recently I retired but I've learned Python data science packages just for fun, and now I use Jupyter inside of VScode on Linux, and enjoy keeping up even tho I don't work at all.

Also it would be great if you answer comments at the end of the video, given that there are relevant questions of course. I think that would put even more information into your already very informative videos!
Speaking of questions: Here's one:
So I watched your Udemy course and how you talked about reaching out to recruiters or just in general experienced people and how you should try to schedule a call within a specific timeframe. You also said it's always a good idea to try and give ""something back"", so to offer to the other person some sort of help. My question would be, what type of help can someone offer, when they are a student or just in general less experienced?

My question is after I saw the great work Darwin did, is it enough to just focus on like 2 projects or 1 that are/is in our field of interest is?

1565,"After watching this conversation and doing some careful consideration (including trying Datacamp vs. Dataquest) I ended up subscribing to a month of Dataquest and am really happy a  week in.  The context was that even though I had done a self-instruction path of working on projects, including for my current clients, I realized there were major holes in my fundamentals on both Python and R.  So even though I currently have projects I do every day using Pandas, R, and SQL, working in combination for real-world results, I was doing things like Leetcode and realizing my Python basics were really shaky.  Based on this interview in your video, and your feedback about value of looking for free resources vs. paying to have it all in one place, organized well, and with a good teaching tool, I opted to try this for a month.  I was immediately paid back with learning almost all of the exact things I had questions about or was missing in my current knowledge.  I was also very impressed with the curriculum on Dataquest and feel it is worth the monthly payments right now to very quickly acquire a base standard of data science knowledge that is in some ways 1:1 with current standard practices and knowledge.  Given your 66 days of data science challenge coming up, I think it was fortunate timing for my own ongoing efforts to pivot to this field from my current area of expertise, online programmatic ad ops.

Thank you so much, you came from havean for me.

I started learning just around a month ago (Im lost .....ü§™)

for me as an electrical engineer (Industrial: oil & gas), data science like different planet.
my mathematical background is very strong, but coding experience is absolute zero.

I found myself really taken by data science.
For now, i focus only on Python, (we will see the rest after that)
check out freecodecamp.org, they have a very great program with free certificate. their YouTube videos made by university doctors

I actually worked on building a simple Youtube Video categorization model using just the title and description. When I plotted those text metadata using a T-SNE plot I could see that videos from the same category where not compressed together rather they were scattered around forming occasional blobs of different category videos clustered together.

So, I wanted to know that how does Youtube actually categorize its videos because 'title+description' doesnt seem to be very specific.

How about meeting on a regular basis on Kaggle and talking about our progresses? And, of course, help each other out, share notes and, even better, work together on a project once we're good enough one of these days? :)

And since I am still trying to sort out a few things both in tracking my progress and trying to establish a clearer road map, seeing this on my computer this morning came as an incredibly great blessing, thank you !!  :)
Now question: Could you and us the rest of your community also have some discussion on, say, Kaggle on regular basis? I feel like that, for newcomers like me, it would help navigate the kaggle ""maelstrom"" and be less intimidated, as well as having a clearer road map.
As for you, it would help you both reexamine your fundemantals through teaching as well as helping you establish yourself as a good, proficient teacher that has both passion for the field and is teaching it with the best of intentions. :)
And I assume when we, your followers and students, start becoming proficient and say 'Ken Jee was instrumental in this' ... well ...

With that being said I am going to be attending Illinois  ITech and would love to know your thoughts on attaining an accelerated masters in Computer science or Data Science. The pros and cons between the two. I am acquiring a bachelors in Computer science and am wondering if it would be more beneficial to acquire the data science degree with the Internship opportunities down town Chicago or master in CS. I am intrigued in both computer science and data science but I lean towards mastering in data because I feel like a bachelors in CS is already enough.

1763,"Hey Ken, I was not sure if you saw the response I made on your scraping glassdoor video. But here is the code that scrapes the titles of glass door. 

The main advantages are that it is more efficient(code wise) and it is much faster then selenium. I also did this in beautiful soup which Is not a super scalable library, but it illustrates the power of scraping tools. If you want to scale on a larger level, I recommend learning scrapy. Additionally, there is also a tool available that lets you select the exact css element of a web-page I will re-link it again. Anyways, here is the code that scrapes the job titles for glassdoor. 

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.request import urlopen,Request
import pandas as pd 
import random
import pickle



headers = {""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.3""}



website = ""https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_KO0,14.htm""

for i in range(1):
    req = Request(website, headers=headers)
    page = urlopen(req)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
    for item in soup.select("".jobLink span""):
        print(item.get_text())


Lastly, you may be wondering how to go to different pages with the code and how you can scrape elements that are not on the front page of the website. Well to answer the former, you would implement a technique called pagination (I will link an article for this) and for the latter, you would scrape each link on the website and iterate through each page collecting all the elements contained on each page.",UgwV_tGfEw_olXI9XYh4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrNjworlAMveVOAJCjTjpjQ,Flawed Logic,2,1,2020-08-26 05:47:53+00:00,q6Lf2yhvluw,2,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 17 (Best Portfolio Website Yet?),2020-08-26

How to interact on kaggle to attract the attention of other people, the kind that are helpful and, likewise, how can a newbie, like me, make a contribution ourselves as beginners on kaggle.
And in general, what are the best ways to interact on the platform. 
I ask because I believe finding some form of mentor-ship from experienced people is one of biggest key or advantages you can get in learning any field, but ML in particular ( your youtube videos and frank kane courses from sundog are good example). 
Of course, gaining some kind of a more direct mentor-ship goes hand in hand with yourself being able to help and make contributions in return (which seems the whole philosophy being kaggle) so I was wondering if you would be willing to share a few secrets there.

1971,"Hello there :)

I haven't watched the full video yet, but there's a reason for this and is linked to a suggestion I'd like to propose to you for similar videos in the future:

Despite being very VERY green in this, I decided to have a first go at this all by myself ... and boy was and is it still frustrating :P The reason behind this was that I wanted to try a first attempt without a guiding hand. Once I finished my first model, I quickly realized that there were tons of ways where I blundered like a total noob ... which is actually totally fine :) And despite the frustration of the experience, it felt like I gathered valuable experience from this.

And it is only now that I am starting to watch this video .. but only bit by bit, as I want to try to do as much by myself as possible (mistake be damned since they are being done at home where it won't hurt anyone and where I can learn safely from the experience).

SO my suggestion is this:
Could it be possible for future similar videos to have it in several parts? Or, at the very least, to timestamp the different section of your handling of a particular problem? I feel like it could be very valuable, especially for very recent newcomers like me. 

Anyways, thanks a ton for your videos, very much appreciated ! (especially some of the code where you use apply and lambda functions to handle data transformations, this is definitely something that will be useful for me in the near and long future! :)

2)Tensorflow is a pain for my python version (3.7). Which python version/environment do you suggest for installing and using Tensorflow successfully?

2166,"Dear Ken, am sorry to hear about this.

The saddest thing is that those who indulge to plagiarism do not understand that this practice tends to damage themselves, and you rightly highlight this aspect.

If we want to strive for excellence, then we must unveil the logic and try hard on our own. Plagiarism does give one the opportunity to feel knowledgeable for one day, but in the long term it will likely show how miserable one is.

The question is, how might we seek out whether we have been plagiarized? 

The topic of plagiarism concerns youtube too. Do you want evidence?
Just look around and see how many times people post videos using copyrighted material. Soccer is one of the many examples. Or TV/radio programs. People merely do NOTHING and try to get visibility - and even money - using other's effort.

I recently had a quarrel with another guy who said, ""You can wipe your axx with the Ethics. In youtube world this makes no sense.""

2173,"Hello all and Mr. Ken Jee,

It is very humble of Mr. Ken to just have a light eye the  person who copied his work. I am a learning individual myself. I do visit kaggle and github but to just get an idea of how the person has solved the problem and then i take almost one to two weeks to come up with my own unique solution. Solving takes time. Learn from elders and create something on your own. Again Mr. Ken is being very much liberal here. But you will face a big issue when you go for Masters or research jobs. You will get caught and it won't look good. One other thing that Mr. Ken did not address of course he doesn't want to scare the young ones is that a company hold power to blacklist you after being caught of fraud. This means that you won't be able to apply for that company for upto 3 years or forever depending on the policy and also the company can suggest your blacklisted profiles to partner organizations and you will be totally **screwed**. 

Shadow learning is something very important to learn. Shadows learning suggests learning the first principles from others works . This means learning the thought process and not copying the core work. Most of the researchers have 2 ways of reaching a new success. One is making something better or creating something new. Shadow learning is something Einstein has done it himself. He worked as a clerk in a patent office for years going through the research papers or maxwell's , newtons , etc. Did he copy ? Absoluetly not. When he found out that he was a bit lagging in the math section of E=MC^2 he contacted maxwell for his expertise on the derivations. That's how we have Einsein-Maxwells Equation. See. Einstein himself wasn't shy of giving credit to the fellow scientists. Why should kids like us be shy of mentioning a partner or co worker or the sources name or the persons name ? 

Have an open mind like newton. Let the apple fall and create something new. 

Cheers and All the best . 
People are good but people who share credits are  great.

2203,"Great topic and good video. I think you set the appropriate tone overall.
I believe most people learn by copying/following along/mimicry (whatever it is called) at first. I know that I have reproduced projects for the sake of learning. Now when I follow along with someone's project I find it REALLY helpful to state where it came from on top. This way I know where it came from and can return to the original material later if need be. 
My personal thinking is that many, many, many (did I say 'many' enough) people forget the internet is open, to a fault.",UgwA0pUvVqrww3AFN2d4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkIkc77YacDWe1ieUFpMsFQ,Matt Curcio,1,2,2020-08-07 17:06:44+00:00,vQGJvmhpq_s,1,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,2020-08-07
2204,"This is a very important topic, I agree!
As you have said, using someone else's code is very common in DS or just tech in general,
however it is important to credit the people correctly.
Some people may think ""I could have written that code myself"", which can of course be true in some situations,
but I like to think that using code is at least somewhat comparable to quoting in literature.
If you use a normal sentence such as ""the weather was nice"" obviously you don't need to quote anyone.
But if you want to use a longer paragraph of text (or code, in that matter) it is very important to show the source.
Now in literature this is made pretty easy by placing quotation marks and just referencing the author but because code
stays below the surface in many areas plagiarism can go unnoticed for far longer, even though it is not less important to credit people in
tech than it is in literature.
Thank you for making this video and bringing a bit of light onto this topic, I think this is something which should be made very clear!

Edit: When writing I just noticed that it makes a lot of sense for one's self to give proper credit as well. As you said it makes people happy to see their code being used well. So if you give proper credit you not only make yourself feel good, because you did the right thing, but also the creator, because their work was used and they got credit. On the other hand, if you don't credit, you feel bad for plagiarizing and the other person becomes angry because of it. So giving proper credit is basically a win-win!",UgzdoraYnEIrmKc53jZ4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXOdh3pTBBovDXzkUkTuvKA,Boris Giba,1,1,2020-08-07 16:41:34+00:00,vQGJvmhpq_s,1,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,2020-08-07

2212,"Thank you for this informative video Sir, this is truly helpful to young inexperienced present and soon to become data scientists such as myself. As far as plagiarism goes with respect to code I have a question. I'm sure that even on the internet there are some niche, common and popular data sets which are considered to be the kind of must do's for new data scientists. In such a scenario its probable that 2 entirely different unrelated and isolated data scientists decide to use the exact same methodology to analyze the data, in such scenarios how should one go about giving the due credit to the people who have already employed similar if not the same method for analysis? 
Additionally on a completely unrelated note I have a school level (class 11th and 12th, high school) coding competition coming up comprising of 2 rounds. The first one being questions related to coding and java, python and c++ and the 2nd round being solving 3 real world problems using code under the span of 1 hour. The second round is purely python coding based. I only know vanilla python well (most of the general functions and methods) and have no experience with either java or c++. I was thinking of learning some modules I've briefly learned the foundations of throughout high school such as numpy, math, csv and either pyqt5 or tkinter. Do you have any tips for me that could help me win this competition? Its my first coding competition and I want to test myself against other coders from other schools and most of all see if my efforts have borne fruit. Any tips or other modules I should revise or learn would be extremely helpful.
Finally I have one last question, I've researched this quite a bit on both YouTube and the internet through articles but I haven't found any satisfactory answer to a question. What's it like to be a Data Scientist, I'm not asking the work schedule or when a DS wakes up what he/she does at the start of the day and then what they do at work and after returning home what work do they do related to DS. I want to know what is a data science life in general, what do you do on off days, how much ""me"" time do you get, what kind of holidays do you get to connect with friends and families and just take it easy and take a break from work. I'm eager to know the ""life"" side of work life balance with regards to being a data scientist.
Sorry if the comment is a bit too long, its just that for me you are the only working professional and mentor figure I can ask these kinds of questions. I'll be really glad if you respond. And again, thank you for making these videos, they are a huge help.",UgyXRA0TIvEDPPPQazZ4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKf0pIXi1GL6LYL-qCyKm_w,Jai Gaurav,3,1,2020-08-07 15:39:29+00:00,vQGJvmhpq_s,3,The Plagiarism Problem in Data Science,2020-08-07

I am familiar with Excel, R, and statistical packages like EViews & SPSS, but I was rejected from many Data Analyst internships in the US. So for now I started an internship in Morocco, where I basically make a questionnaire for a certain sampe, collect data, and analyse results. I have been also learning Python and Tableau because they were mentioned in the requirements of most Data analyst internships. Do you think I can land an internship next spring in the US with my anticipated level. Also how was the evolution of Data Analyst jobs and internships impacted by Covid 19.

2294,"Thank you for making this informative video Sir! You stated that inculcation of an additional discipline along with Data Science provides a boost to your resume, however for students who are aspiring to be data scientists and will shortly join college, how will they be able to get the added benefit of having experience in another discipline. If I restrict my argument to myself, I will be pursuing either a DS or a CS under graduate degree, how can I compete against individuals who have the added edge of another discipline. 
Another question I have is could you do a full tutorial style video on how one goes about making their profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub or Stack Overflow (And which platform carries the most weight in recruiters' eyes), as an adolescent I feel daunted by the thought of making a good profile as not only am I inexperienced but I'm also unaware of the do's and dont's. Videos such as these project reviews are extremely useful for more experienced watchers but a video targeted towards the newcomers would be a boon.

2348,"Youtube suggested your channel and I had to watch. It was last week. Then I returned in order to find a video on ""Where"" to start learning. But, what you talked about was ""How to learn"". I mean, the advices were ""No matter what courses you watch, just make sure to do in a way that you feel that works for you. Look into Kaggle and learn from built projects"" and such. However what I couldn't find is exactly where to start on languages. 

Please, please, don't get me wrong I'm just trying to understand where to focus the inicial focus to learn this science.


What I was looking for was something more fundamental, like ""Start learning Progamming Logics, then you should tackle the basics of a programming language like R or Python, then you should learn about DB with...""
I don't even know if it is necessary to learn about database to be on Data Science lol.

Again, don't get me wrong. In reality I'm asking you: What are the fundamentals to start to learn this awesome job?
I see the enthusiasm about this topic on your videos and for a long time I had this will to learn, however I'm not a programmer myself, in any language at all. Could you please, help me to find the initial step?

Thank you for your videos, they made me like Data Science even more, even when I don't understand almost nothing about this world.

2438,"Hello Ken, really cool video. I have a question for you. You gave us all the important variables that contributed to the model at around 32:30. I was wondering, with those variables in mind, are we able to dig a little deeper and see what the actual values were that contributed most to the model? 
If that sounds confusing, here is an example. Age is the second most significant variable in the model. If we can program what I just asked you, the model would ""spit"" out ages 15-18 years, I do not know if that's true, old were the most significant and contributed most to the model.

2639,"Hello Sir! I'm a student whose currently studying in class 12th and I've chosen the career path of a Data Scientist. Your channel is actually the first channel I've ever subscribed to, because from the first video that I saw on your channel about whether one should choose a bootcamp, a certificate or a masters' degree, I've been hooked to your channel and have seen most of your videos. First of all thank you for making them, its extremely difficult to find any person on youtube or otherwise that provides such comprehensive guides, it really helps aspiring data scientists like me a lot! Secondly I'd like to ask you whether I should aim for a CS undergraduate degree or a DS one, I've seen a plethora of videos and then I've realized that at present the CS is the go to degree, however the shift of preference from CS to DS is occurring and I'm trying to think ahead that when I graduate, would a DS degree increase my chances of getting hired or would the norm still remain CS. I'd be extremely grateful if you could provide some insight into this.
As for the name of your new beast of a machine, I'd suggest the name Kronos from Greek mythology, the Titan of Time (I'm a fan of Percy Jackson and other works of Rick Riordan). Kronos would probably be the perfect name because -
1. You said at the start your build was made around your gpu, the rtx TITAN, so for the computer to share a name with an actual Titan from mythology would be pretty cool
2. Seeing the specs I'm sure this machine will be crazy fast and that'll result in much faster response times and code compilation times, seeing that time is such an essential aspect here it makes the name Kronos even more fitting since he was the Titan of Time
3. The age of the Titans is called the Golden Age in greek mythology, seeing that your graphics card is also golden, i think it makes perfect sense

Once again thank you making these videos, they really are a huge help!

2691,"Thanks Ken for this amazing podcast, really enjoyed the discussion. I totally agreed on sharing data science work socially. As a researcher, sharing my data science work on has opened several doors of opportunities. For one, people who see the work that I share socially may reach out to me with opportunities to apply for research grants, to take part in awesome collaborative research projects, to take part in editorial roles in research journals, prospective students reach out to join our research group, serve as the starting point for collaborative discussions, to serve as external examiners of PhD dissertation, etc. 
     As a YouTuber, I learn a lot from the subscribers (questions, suggestions, feedbacks, tips and tricks, etc.), collaborate and engage in discussions with other awesome YouTubers such as Ken Jee, Krish Naik, Dhaval Patel, Jay Feng, Jaemin Lee, etc. 
     Aside from this, the act of sharing is like paying it forward.

Put another way, is it more important in these types of projects to show knowledge of how these models actually work, or to show that you can use tools and libraries (like sklearn) proficiently?",Ugyhe8Iur4GTFzL8_jt4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClUoofNCUH8pHPrBGSUA1hA,Bryan Lo,1,1,2020-07-18 00:37:01+00:00,I3FBJdiExcg,1,Beginner Kaggle Data Science Project Walk-Through (Titanic),2020-07-18

Even though this internship hasn‚Äôt had me use any physics so far, I‚Äôve found the analysis very interesting. I would really like to get a job in data science without going to graduate school. What would you recommend that I do in the next year while I finish up college to best prepare me to land a job? I go to Texas A&M, so we have a huge network, but I don‚Äôt know where to start (other than using the kaggle courses). I‚Äôve tried looking at job postings and it seems like all the jobs require a masters degree and/or 4+ years of experience.

You just click on the top menu bar ""Edit > Check Spelling"" or Ctrl+I for the shortcut.  Coming from an art background, I would still advise giving Adobe Illustrator another shot.

3006,"Hi Ken Jee, thanks for the great content!  I decided around March that I wanted to make a career change into data science and quickly realized it was going to take a lot longer than I originally thought.   Although I have a degree in aerospace engineering I have been working in sales for the past 8 years so my technical skills weren't where they needed to be.  Anyways,  after doing some research I came to the conclusion that starting out in a data analyst role might be a more attainable path for me because of my lack of experience and that form there I could transition into data science once I have real world experience.  
My question for you is, do you believe entering the industry as a data analyst is a good way to do it?  Also, do you have any tips for writing a good resume when you don't have experience?   
I have been taking online courses in SQL and Python and feel pretty proficient in SQL but not so much in Python, still need to work more on that.

I say this because it seems most job listings require or prefer some kind of quantitative degree, and exercise science does not seem to make the cut.

3011,"I found this video to be extremely basic and vague (and the video doesn't quite match the contents: you show very expensive components and then speak how it's not really necessary to have powerful PC for beginners). The general recommendations are fine, but there is no explanation as for when and why you would want to get anything better than Ryzen 5.

What tasks are particularly CPU focused, and will benefit noticeably from e.g. Ryzen 9 processor? If it can save you several hours of computing a day, it can be a big deal, but if it says less than a hour, it's mostly pointless.

The same goes for graphic card. Nvidia RTX Titan seems extremely overpriced for what it does. From what I can tell, it's only slightly better than RTX 2080 Ti, and cots twice as much. Is there even any reason to get it? Maybe some additional optimization for Data Science tasks? So far it looks extremely cost ineffective, even for highest end PC. Might as well get something cheaper for now and then upgrade to RTX 3000 when it launches.

Again, unless it can save several hours of computing every day, I don't see how it makes any sense at all.

Additionally, I wonder how impactful RAM memory speed is for Data Science tasks. Does it make sense to overclock your RAM, or is it just a waste of time and effort?

Finally, I'm not sure if it's correct to simply ignore Motherboard and PSU (You listed a 500$ PC, and then you mentioned 200$ for motherboard and other components, which practically increases the price by 50%). Again, depending on how important storage speed is, it might make sense to get a more expensive motherboard, such as B550 or X570. However, if it's not as important, and regular NVME SSD is more than good enough, then good B450 board is plenty powerful. As for storage Samsung NVME SSDs are way overpriced, so I wouldn't recommend one personally. Good ADATA NVME costs just 70-75$ for 500 GB, and is only marginally slower.

My recommended budget build based in my understanding will depend on the country, but in short here doesn't seem to be any significant differences from general gaming build recommendations.

For processor I'd get Ryzen 5 1600 AF if it's available for under 110$, otherwise Ryzen 5 3600 is the best choice.

For memory if speed is not super important for Data Science tasks I'd recommend Crucial Ballistix Black 2x8 GB 3200 MHz. Even if it is this kit has good overclocking capabilities. Wouldn't get anything below 16 GB, as Chrome is a memory hog, and you likely need a lot of tabs open for data science projects.

For motherboard I'd recommend B450 Mortar Max or Tomahawk Max, as those support upgradability. For cheaper options B450 PRO-VDH Max is also good.

For SSD ADATA SX8200 Pro 500/1000 GB is the best choice (depending on your preferences regarding regularly cleaning your PC). I wouldn't get anything below 500 GB myself, since this will likely cause major inconveniences.

For PSU anything 550-650W is good enough. I wouldn't get anything below Gold certification if your PC runs for 10+ hours every day. If available at reasonable price, Deepcool DQ-650M is a good choice.

Monitor doesn't really matter for Data Science, so anything cheap and sturdy will do.

Graphic card is a tricky one. I'd probably try to look for a good used option for a budget build, but it's hard to find a reliable seller. I assume Nvidia cards are easier to use for Data Science, as AMD cars get less support. Used GTX 1060 6GB is a bare minimum I'd recommend, but if you can afford a more expensive one, 2070 Super looks like an optimal choice in terms of cost to performance. Personally I'd get 1060, and then upgrade to RTX 3070 when available.

As for the case, anything above 60$ should be fine. Got myself new MSI MAG case, it's quite, runs pretty old and comes with fans already pre-installed. More premium options are Phantex P400A, and Meshify C.

Secondary components like motherboard, PSU and case may seem unimportant, but they ultimately affect performance, reliability, upgradability and longevity of the system as we.

Still would like to know how important memory speed is for Data science tasks. 16 GB 2400 MHz and 16 GB 3800 MHz are 2 completely different kits for some tasks.",Ugxn84pxw2qDi-MsktZ4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXQyP4cgZzqbdOlWC3dzUg,Andrey Protas,1,0,2020-07-10 19:54:15+00:00,QQLToUlgN7A,1,The Best Computer for Data Science Beginners,2020-07-10

I was wondering the level of math you need for DS, I‚Äôm getting mixed results in my research. I was a biology major in undergrad and the highest math I ever had to take was calculus I (basically just doing derivatives), and this was a long time ago so I don‚Äôt remember how to do it anymore. I was exploring data science masters back in my school and others, and they‚Äôre open to non STEM majors, and the most math they require was statistics.
  Do you need to know differential equations, linear algebra, and more advanced calculus? Or statistics and the various statistical tests covered in statistics will be fine?",UgyLuvdtd7o8UFw8Uwh4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK-IFb7OawqPSiFGQv8JL2w,Chowder1054,3,6,2020-07-10 16:59:49+00:00,3Mm1U1CbzNw,3,Is Data Science Right For You?,2020-07-10

i saw that both you and this guy are interested in data science, so i woud like to listen also your tips.
I have a question about data science filed: do you think that a bachelor degree in statistic is more useful than a computer science degree for go into this field? in my country statistic is a sub field of social scinece and there are only few course of computer science,just databases,fundametal programming and statiscal sw. 
A computer scientist has more skills in programming,they study for example more sw exams  (sw enginners,operation system ) but less statistic,probability ecc.
I read that company prefer more computer scientist beacause they dont nedd statistician that are expert in hard modelling,math ecc but they usually ""suck"" in it field,like programming ecc.  but they need only basic knowledge of statistic and a lot of It skills.
So wht do you think, is a good investimetn a bachelor in statisitic or is better a computer science degree? there are a lot of master degree in data science from both accademical course, a lot of people with a bachelour in computer science go in to statistic and viceversa.

3051,"I'm trying to decide if this field is for me. I use Sales Force at work and  occasionally have to pull raw data from it. I use rudimentary search words or phrases to try to isolate cases our front line agents log from their customer contacts.

Often, however, there are limits to the results I get and almost always the data I get is so poorly captured that it inevitably means I have to manually read hundreds of thousands of records individually to see if there are trends. The categorization of the data is a separate challenge of its own.

We have folks who created a system that does this automatically, however, it's still high level information the way the issues get bucketed. It's also about 2-3 days behind so trying to get data real time is another limit.

I'm new to this, so I envision being to run raw data up to hour and be able to paint the picture of what's driving call volume, trends, for example, that we may need to act on immediately and then having technology/automation do the grunt work to classify the data and give me actionable information to present to my team and leadership. But as I see it, there's the obstacle of getting good data from the agents as the major issue in its own.  Is this even possible? Has anyone else run into this?

I was going to take master's degree in data science in Illinois institute of tech (IIT) from this fall semester (my bachelor is CS) but I got rejected because I didn't take prerequisites such as calculus 1-3 and linear algebra. And then I had to change my major to something related, so I chose IT management in the end because I was interested in management and MBA as well since before. But even now I still feel like compared to data science, my major doesn't seem to be that professional. So I was thinking of teaching myself some mathematics and then studying data analytics with using either R or python through free online courses.

I am doing Twitter sentiment analysis and learning NLP.

I have a question, i refer to other people's github for guidance... Like the github i am refering for twitter sentiment analysis uses NLTK but in my project i am using spaCy..

3202,"Thank you so much for this series, it's really helpful for beginners like me. I have a question though, I followed almost exactly how you revised the codes, the only difference is probably that I am using data from both Canada and USA, and the ""salary estimate"" column shows all identical values (e.g. CA$89K-CA$100K (Glassdoor Est.)) but all the other columns (e.g. rating, company name) are just fine.

I have obtained Master degree in Telecommunications and am working as a network engineer. I have realized that I miss programming so much since I was very good at it and math in high school. I had some programming on college (C, MATLAB, some very basic Python), but since then stopped programming because my job doesn't require it. I like data science, artificial intelligence and Python, so I enrolled in PhD program in IoT where I've got some subjects such are Neural networks and Artificial intelligence in telecommunications.
Please, do you have any advice on how to manage my time since I am doing a job with shifts, have to study and make projects for PhD and need to learn Python, statistics and similar topics in order to make career change and become data scientist? I would much appreciate if you give me concrete examples/materials what to study and pace for passing them.

Thank you really for everything you share with us. I've started my journey in data science a couple months ago. I completed a bachelor's degree in statistics and I would like to convert into Data scientist.
I have some questions for you and I thank you in advance for your answers.
- with my statistician background, do you think I can be good enough to have a job in datascience?
- I have completed datascience 365 bootcamp and I want to know ways to apply all the knowledge I got there.
- how can I find a distance job in any company or enterprise, because in my home country it is quiet difficult since we don't have enterprises really needing it.

Thanks a lot and I don't know if I can get your mail for further discussions.

Resources mention that is good practice to write functions... So i did... Then i stumble across custom transformers, now I'm trying to create one to use it rather than the individual functions


What is the difference between using lambda funcitons( like in here) and creating the custom transfomers?

Is it good to write one transformer that will deal with all the steps (cleaning, custom value inputing, changing types of values, discretizing, aggregating categories, etc, etc)  to get my dataset ready?
Or what am i supposed to do?
Then i would like to use it in a pipeline to finish with encoding and scaling...

I'm kinda lost and can't find any good resource to solve this...

Thank so much you and keep the good work!",UgzDA0YtTl1czFLc0M14AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcyGe-7yAUpRD4nhqnJsiRg,Daniel Guerra,2,1,2020-06-15 21:22:50+00:00,fhi4dOhmW-g,2,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),2020-06-15

3540,"Nice video! I'm not familiar with your channel but saw the thumbnail/its length and clicked through - a few other ideas/resources to choose from that I think can be really helpful for beginners depending on how they like to learn:
---------------
1. Make a habit of partitioning off a small portion of your learning time to do some light reading on best practices - this is softer information and can often be more subjective than the harder skills, but it can be extremely helpful in adding context to why certain things are the way they are and potentially help save you some cleanup down the road (things like docstrings, virtual environments, project directory structure, etc). (Like everything else) this can be overwhelming and my advice would also be to choose one thing at a time and start trying to build it into your workflow - docstrings and virtual environments are both good examples of things that take a little getting used to but can feel very fluid after a short period of time and save a lot of headaches with package managers (+ if you're using vscode or PyCharm the autodocstrings are great and keep your time spent doing the things the machine can't, not playing with margins)
---------------
2. Listening to podcasts about the subject (IMO) is also extremely valuable and can be done on the go - even if as a beginner you don't understand much that they're talking about, hearing others talk about common problems before you get to them can help you understand what's happening more quickly whenever you do. Additionally, a huge part of this field is learning how to articulate the problem you're trying to solve for on google/stack, and listening to podcasts can help you learn how to articulate things better both verbally and in writing. I'm much less familiar with the R podcast landscape but for Python beginners, Talk Python To Me is great for slightly deeper dives into a specific problem domain and Python Bytes is good/fun weekly exposure to the evolving packaging landscape.
2.1 Quick addition to the above point, another thing it can really help with is understanding the extent to which most problems, particularly on the data processing/cleansing/wrangling front have already been solved for - I've often seen more novice programmers try to recreate the wheel at every turn and hearing more experienced people unpack how they approach problem solving can help save you from writing a script to do something that's part of a standard library.
---------------
3. Time spent finding the right resources is never time wasted - in addition to paid courses/etc, I'd encourage finding someone on Youtube/similar who does a good job of articulating things in a way that makes sense to you. Corey Schafer has a  fantastic Python channel covering everything from basics/best practices to end-to-end application development
---------------
4. Acknowledging that this would fall somewhere towards the latter half of the progression outlined in your video, I think it's super worth calling out that all the services we use personally have open APIs from which we can programmatically extract our data from and can be a great way to build out your mechanics in a fun/more personal way - it's also a natural and safer step towards web scraping since it's all the same communication protocol. Amongst many others, Spotify has a super user-friendly API and a well-supported helper library called Spotipy for anyone who might like this idea and be looking for a place to start Python beginnings to start learning how APIs work.
---------------

I relate to the small wins thing as well whether it would be making tutorials for Data Science concepts for the organization that I'm a part of, the Bit Project, or making projects through the knowledge that I have gained through tutorials.

3618,"I already had a solid Math background when I started learning DS - but my graduation was 25 years ago :) I also had a LOT of programming experience, but not in Python or R. And still, my greatest problem wasn't the Math or the Python, it was *lack of the systematic approach*.
When you go for one of the countless ""become a data scientist in 10 hours"" course, you don't really understand that material. The worst thing is you might THINK you understand it, but that's a false feeling. There is no way to understand it all in 10 hours, be prepared for a long journey or retreat. There are three books that I recommend to everyone:
1). Mathematics for Data Scientists (M.P.Deisenroth and others) - all math you will need in a convenient form.
2). Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analysis (Johh D. Kelleher and others) - everything about Machine Learning except for the neural networks.
3). Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron - a great book about Deep Learning (you may skip the other parts).

All three books have a lot of exercises, and you should do ALL of them. After that you will know enough to consider your knowledge solid.

3625,"Hi Ken, as always it's a pleasure to watch your video that distinguishes you from the many yackers around talking about data science.

When i was listening to you, it came into my mind Tim Ferris and i thought about ""selection"", one of the key steps to learning.
In my idea, to learn data science the first step involves figuring out what are the most frequently used and important mathematical models and algorithms.¬†
Once we have this shortlist, we can select key programming languages - i personally opt for Python and R - and try to work out real-world problems with these 2 languages.¬†

How, do we do to know if we are gonna do well? One way is to pick algorithms as performed in any of the courses you proposed (or even in Kaggle, where i have been starting giving a look), implementing to the real-world problems as said above and double-checking the solution by implementing the same algorithms using secondary, high-level programming environments like Matlab or Mathematica. 
I know that mathematica has lot of functions that help you do what in python requires dozens of lines.

I think the advice you give is very useful, because I've been following the same methodology when learning Data Science for the past year. I'm try to understand and practice each individual part of the whole process of building a project first and then in the end everything manages to piece together perfectly after that. I've been solving Rubik's cubes as a hobby since 2009, so I think I'm pretty good at not giving up when something gets difficult.

3773,"I think learning by doing is a wonderful, fun and efficient way to learn a range of skills.  HOWEVER, after 40+ years developing for large, medium and small commercial, non-profit, military/defense and other companies across communications, strategic data, media, AI, quantum-AI, full stack and other areas, I have also seen the dangers of that as a primary, let alone singular learning approach.   

People who learn exclusive via doing‚Äî especially working predominately on their own while eschewing theory and complementary skills prior to that approach, often have major applied theory and application context gaps in their knowledge that they appear generally unaware of.  Obviously, this depends whether you are learning predominately on your own, or if you have guide(s), mentor(s) and/or teacher(s) that help point out short-comings and gaps in your knowledge base and approaches. 

There are multiple factors underlying this problem.  First, it is very hard for most people to deeply self-introspect to see where they lie on broad based external knowledge continuums without significant sources of historical, theoretical and contextual reference.  This is why the first factor of where people are on the Dunning-Kruger curve skews left with people who have largely self-educated without a broader base of external references as noted above.  

The second factor is the fact that most of the time, most people simply do not know what they don‚Äôt know.  In other words, it takes a broad base of external theoretical, historical and contextual learning to develop metacognitive skills to help us intuit where we have gaps in our knowledge base, and to consistently discern correct from incorrect conclusions.  While working on our own is a great way to learn deep, practical skills, we see that it often comes along with blinders to broader alternative views and approaches.  In other words, you can easily be unwittingly blind to the fact that your toolbox is mostly bare, and that you don‚Äôt know how to optimally use even the tools you do have.  For example, we see people who have never heard of Donald E. Knuth, JADD or Charles Petzold that have instead learned simply by doing, who code using approaches that others have long since bypassed, resulting in programming that causes problems and often must be rewritten and projects that must be taken over by other groups‚Äî ideally prior to them causing real world problems in the end user community.  

So, while there is no substitute for hands on learning and many have succeeded in becoming gainfully employed as programmers without much classical computer programming training or academic education;  even hands-on learning approaches work better in the form of a balanced apprenticeship approach, where you work autonomously, but under the direction and oversight of someone much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself.

The fact is that the number of software developers on the planet doubles every 5 years.  As such, by definition this means that half of software developers have less than 5 years experience.  The number goes down as you get to more specialized areas of knowledge that increasingly can have a broad based impact in unforeseen ways on the future of humanity.  For example, the number of AI programmers is doubling every 12-14 months and is still falling.  

This means that on average, AI programmers have a year or less programming skills in AI.  Increasingly, the percentage that have any significant general programming or computer science education is dropping, as the demand for AI programmers is far outstripping what our universities and training centers can provide.  As such, more people are self-educating, often by jumping in and doing prior to getting any significant training.  

Sadly, many of us who don‚Äôt get the academic knowledge and theory up front, never go back later to address that, since they get too busy and immerse in immediate needs.  So, the gaps and deficiencies upon entering the workforce often are carried throughout their carrier.  Often they become highly proficient programmers and such, in whatever language(s) they happen to need for the tasks at hand, but they often don‚Äôt learn to intuit when, for example they should turn to something like Node.js versus Python, or use Matlab vs Tensorflow, etc,

So, what is the negative result of people learning predominately hands-on rather than under the oversight of others who are significantly more knowledgeable and skilled, and preferably with a good foundation of theory and broad based learning to bolster their metacognitive, theory and analytical skills development?   The result is that suboptimal approaches, zero hour bugs, and higher rates of failed projects, as defined by the failure to meet one or more primary deliverables as defined by the final SOW.   

Further, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more.  We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD‚Äôs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people from a financial standpoint, what are the alternatives?  First, online learning when done in conjunction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful high utility educational base.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in. 

Also, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more.  We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD‚Äôs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people, what are the alternatives.  First, online learning when done in conjuction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful way to learn.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in.  For example, say you spent a few hundred hours learning and taking on a few projects in Python and Swift.  You should also read several of the seminal computer programming theory and related books‚Äî at the very least in the areas you are focusing on, and preferably add to them over time once you have internalized their benefit.  Statistics repeatedly show that people who never learned core theory prior to beginning a career have a much lower chance of ever learning those areas.

Similarly, it can be a great boon to identify a local universities or a company that needs interns where you can work under and along side others with different skills. While the pay may be minimal or non-existent, EVERYONE (self-taught, university skilled and all other modalities of learning) should intern‚Äî just as is done in other mission critical and related fields like medicine.   And it is a LOT cheaper than the college alternative.  In medicine it is done on top of 6-9 years of additional post-university graduation education, while in computer programming, a rapidly increasing percentage never even get any post graduation training of any significant merit‚Äî let alone intern/apprenticeship training.   

Is professional programming any less deep or broad of an area of knowledge?   Not if you want to excel in terms of being at least well rounded and far more employable than average‚Äî and definitely not if you wish to excel in skills, compensation and job satisfaction.  So, don‚Äôt migrate primarily to hands-on without getting a good base of other approaches behind you, because statistically you probably will never go back to rectify the competency, knowledge and related gaps you create by doing so.",Ugw59or26G9iQZ4Yayl4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuLhDfyiQvXhwyVpC_a9sGA,Andrew Denis,0,0,2020-06-06 18:28:57+00:00,4OZip0cgOho,0,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),2020-06-06

1. I am currently starting with the housing project and I didn't know how to start on my own so Im using 2 other notebooks as references and kind of copy pasting, would you consider that  normal when starting or is it bad ?(I'm gonna reference links to both of them when I finish my work of course)

2. For the getting started projects in Kaggle in general and the ones you mentioned in this video when do you think I can say I succeeded with this project like what's the minimus end goal in the score or something like that ?

.
Here in Brazil we have this kind of discussion every day. And for the ones who is not from the field, but really passionate about data and the math behind it - and of course have enough time to do so -, won't you recommend a second bachelor related to the field? For example: Statistics, Computer Science, Mathmatics, and so on? 
.
Briefly, I think for the tools, softwares, programming languages there are no better place to learn them than in online courses. Thus, the bachelor would give us the theory we need and in parallel sharp our skills with online courses. 
.
I'm curious to know your opinion about it. Cheers from Brazil, buddy!",UgzmdRutZoyRnolJAkd4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0nZtG1E517qCux7GvRvT0w,Humberto Alves,1,1,2020-06-05 11:10:13+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,1,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,2020-06-05

3906,"Hi guys! 
So, it seems like this has stopped working, I found the fix on Github tho, 
Here's how to go about it: 
This can be fixed by modifying the header dictionary in query.py from
HEADER = {'User-Agent': random.choice(HEADERS_LIST)}
to
HEADER = {'User-Agent': random.choice(HEADERS_LIST), 'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'}
that should fix the issue.
Here's the github link: https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/296

3946,"Hi Ken, i need your honest opinion man

I'm confused in choosing between Data Scientist or UX Designer

There are few questions about this topic, but i want to ask from different perspective

I am right now a content creator, was a videographer so i do edit videos and such

Visualization is always a part of me, i like to vizualize things like when i hear music i can imagine the videos that fits the music

But what i asked is much bigger than that

I know lots of people talk about what you're more into, if maths go with data science, if creative go with ux design

However, i want to know how's the life of both careers? Which one offer better work life balance?

Because when i did creative work, i didn't really have work life balance, i did a lot of overwork stuffs, because creative work sometimes requires you to think constantly or out of the box that really absorbed your attention even outside of your work hours.

When i go outside, my body is in holiday mode but my mind is not there, thinking of the unfinished project.

Then second, which one is more important and irreplaceable? Because i see lots of websites now offering design templates which mean maybe in the future, companies don't really need ux designer since they can use good templates from the internet. 

Third, when you become the CEO of the company. Which skill is best to master? Data science or ux design? That will absolute critical as someone in that position. 

Like to hear your thoughts about this, thank you",UgxKGQhrM7h3HfQDrsZ4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC01YFcn8tWckMxkrmOj66Cw,Aldo Novenza,2,2,2020-06-02 06:22:14+00:00,mR2NCRgtLPE,2,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 6 (Only 3 months of coding experience),2020-06-02

One heads up for anyone making their own site in this way:
After uploading files some of the images might not load on the page (when run using Github pages)
This happens because some images that were uploaded have the src = ""/images/.."" 
To get the photos simply edit the index.html file for the pages where the images are missing. 
Change the ""/images/.."" to  ""https://dataprofessor.github.io/Ken_Portfolio/images/.."" and the images will show

Ken¬¥s project series from scratch inspired me to start my own project. The result you can see in this video. But it was a lot of time and effort to get to this point. So, it¬¥s a nice compliment, when someone thinks, that my project can¬¥t be from a beginner.

4162,I am not a data scientist or interested in it but i do a bit of data analysis in my field of learning and development. I primarily use R and I would encourage people not to shy away from R. It's different from pythion because it is a domain specific language while python is a general purpose language. R has some great packages such as the Tidyverse which allows very easy exploration of data. Also you can use R and Python together.,UgxTBqc15jP5Z-yX3LR4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMsywfbXxJvKo0hReZcBDBA,Mobolaji Owoade,2,3,2020-05-26 11:13:43+00:00,VN12ZPFsApM,2,How To Learn Programming for Data Science [3 Steps],2020-05-26

4195,Great series. I'm trying it out after looking at your video. I feel that the per hour salary is just for an hour. While you have replaced the per hour with a blank. Aren't we gonna convert the per hour to the actual salary. By googling I found out that a data scientist in the US works almost 60 hours. Shouldn't we multiply this with the per hour salary and then with 52?,Ugyatd8igjhRhDdTkHd4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM9gA5elUm4nVli06FhtpVA,Shashank S,1,1,2020-05-25 18:45:40+00:00,fhi4dOhmW-g,1,Data Science Project from Scratch - Part 3 (Data Cleaning),2020-05-25

4210,"Liking this Review series!  Absolutely agree with you at 14:38 that tree-based methods may be useful for giving feature importance but the lack of direction in which the features influences the model render it less useful than that of linear model's regression coefficients. Recently, I have been experimenting with the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library (https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and it is filling this need by also giving the direction at which the feature influences the base values along with the magnitude as in linear models, and the great thing is that it works on nearly all ML algorithms too (tree-based included).",Ugzy0NIB0mdhFmKaX-d4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8e2g4IWQqK71bbzGDEI4Q,Data Professor,1,3,2020-05-25 15:03:36+00:00,HJH0gfY6EUg,1,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 5 (Very Detailed Project),2020-05-25

Just wanted to throw this out there. I am 27 with a degree in Finance and a real passion for technology/programming. I was a comp sci major in community college, but didn't give it the time it needed and eventually switched to finance. I quickly realized that I wanted to do something that I was passionate about which is numbers and programming. I found data science. So far on my journey, I have acquired a Certificate in Data Science from UCI (very high-level stuff, didn't really go into great depths, mostly theory), but I always have these doubts that I am too old to get into tech or that I don't have enough real world experience to get into tech.

This really motivates me to improve my own resume, I'm working on it but because I'm from Germany I actually have to translate my homepage so that I can send it out to international recruiters if needed, and that takes up some time as well :D
I think your advice really is valuable even to people outside the US, even though of course the formalities may differ, f.e. in Europe it is much more common (or even expected) to include a personal photo on the resume, but I think that the essence of interviews and what recruiters look for is generally the same across the countries, especially for larger companies like FANG etc. I think the interview process does not differ much.

I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I've been out of college for about 2.5 years now and have recently made the decision to switch to Data Science. I have a decent level of programming experience from my time in college/work with Matlab and C++.

And I'm trying to figure out what the best path to this would be for me? I'm not really in a position to stop working, but my company will pay for me to go back to school up to 10k per year for graduate programs or 5k per year for certifications. Over the past month I've been utilizing as many online free resources to learn as possible including kaggle, LinkedIn learning, etc.

4428,"I have become very confused with the different advice various people give regarding data science. The coding languages like R and python seem to give the user a more technical and intricate level of work but these don't seem inviting to me when there are options like Matlab available which is significantly more user friendly especially for beginners. I graduated with an engineering degree last year, I have since tried to study machine learning with python after having no background in the language and it seemed more difficult to study and memorize all the different algorithms one has to go and create or the the different uses of packages like numpy. On the other hand I started a course on data science with MATLAB and the ease of graphing and using visual aids seemed to make Matlab a more desirable choice for me. That being said, I don't really hear of Matlab being a buzz-word in the data science community, why is this?

Basically, everything you said so far applies equally to both places, specially regarding the number of pages in the CV. I've been working with engineering for some time now, and in Brazil I see a certain tendency of giving more importance to soft skills than to technical skills, at least in my area. The idea is that you can teach somebody how to program, for example, but it's really hard to teach someone how to have be a good team player.

Very cool analysis.  I wonder if you could get the data on strikeouts.  I remember seeing some discussion that the Astros' team strikeout % was significantly lower than the MLB average.  If that is the case, then that would give them an advantage in a number of ways - strikeouts are a key metric for pitchers, especially in high leverage late-game situations.

4486,"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We‚Äôre not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 

2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, ‚Äúalmost no companies know what data science is‚Äù. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it‚Äôs the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That‚Äôs it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I‚Äôm telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 

3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn‚Äôt say data scientist doesn‚Äôt mean your not going to do data science work. I‚Äôm a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE‚Äôs get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. 

My job title is NOT data scientist. 

My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of ‚Äúmust know Python‚Äù, it‚Äôs a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don‚Äôt know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn‚Äôt tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  ‚Äúhello world‚Äù in Python. Yet they‚Äôre interviewing candidates for Python development. üòÅ

If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player. That means work on everything sent your way. And show off your skills. 

Good luck!",Ugzb1fCulqpJm9blNmV4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAgZlr1u3Wb7sYJ9BmvS_fg,Michael Redfern,1,0,2020-05-17 14:05:21+00:00,4OZip0cgOho,1,How I Would Learn Data Science (If I Had to Start Over),2020-05-17

My concern is DS programs are relatively new, and maybe most hiring managers are suspicious about the program and expectation of candidates are not established yet, so they would rather choose candidates with stats background.

1.is ms in data science really worth it from current and future of industry persepectie, like I am seeing that some people prefer 2 years of industrial experience over 2 years of masters but I really like ml and want to publish papers in this domain. 
2.Now i have read couple of books on ml and DL but now i am confused whether (a) . to start learning practical application of ML(like I have build a model but what next..... To make my model more interactive and useful, like I don't want to show companies my (.py file), so to solve that problem maybe I should go for MLops(devops + ml) or
(2) .read more research papers, learn new and advance algo and techniques which no books or course teaches u, start doing competition and maybe go for writing a research paper which would be very helpful for my  ms admission in good college.
Can u help, like any advice would help a lot on what should my direction of working after gaining so much knowledge but have very little practical knowledge of impelnting.

4650,"Hi Ken,
I have a question for you: I'm studying social sciences at the moment with a specialization in quantitative data analysis. We're not just doing basic stuff, I already did courses on geodata analysis, network analysis (even did an analysis of Twitter communities with data that I scraped with the Twitter rest API), multilevel models, structural equation models and causal analysis. But we have no courses on machine learning (actually there would have been a course this semester, but it got dropped because of corona -.- I guess it's too difficult to run a Zoom stream for a guy working with machine learning, idk...). And we also didn't do much on efficient coding / speeding up the code. I'm mostly working with R.
What do you say would be a good next step to get deeper into data science with that pretty solid foundation of knowledge on statistics? Can you recommend courses, books or other sources for my situation? All the data science sources that I found were starting from zero which was a bit annoying for me.

My current situation is that i've graduated with a Honours in Biochemistry and last year i enrolled into another undergraduate degree in Computer Science because I figured I would switch my career in hopes of finding a job. After completing my 1.5 years, I've decided to take on a Data science course on udemy and has since created 3 personal data science projects. Do you think that's good enough and that I should apply for jobs or should I just finish my Comp sci undergrad. 


Also loving the content you put out!

4739,"I'm in Ireland so the set up is a little different but my original degree was in social science and now I'm doing a higher diploma in Data Science.  This is a post grad qualification that is an add on to your degree but it's not quite a masters either.  Personally I'm coinciding that with different online courses or certificates.  The diploma is  two years part time and it is designed for people with no data science background so there is a lot to cram in. Naturally there will be area's that i'm weaker in or where the diploma does not go into detail as I would like so I use certificates  to fill those gaps.  Mid term term breaks, winter breaks and soon summer breaks are a good time to do these when lectures are no longer running and you've finished up exams.  In saying that university education in Ireland is  a lot cheaper.  My first degree was free and this higher diploma is around 4000 euro in total so I don't mind spending an extra little bit to do some courses in my own time.",UgwrgwCrhQ5cPAk3lih4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDlH3FespdSitl7DF-soW4A,StarMonkies,3,1,2020-05-12 12:55:36+00:00,Q9FjwzKFPuM,3,Data Science Certificate vs Bootcamp vs Masters Degree,2020-05-12

Great video, you gained a subscriber here.
I like more books rather than videos but I will definitely try kagel.


At this moment I'm learning R and I'm following these books that I picked:
Practical Statistics for Data Science; (read)
R for Data Science; (read)
Introduction to Statistical Learning with R; (read)
Elements of Statistical Learning; (on it)
Advanced R; (next)


Any books you recommend to fill some gaps here?

I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree, and I would love to transition to the field of Data Science. I am planning to do that by enrolling into the Masters Program. Another reason why I want to get the Masters is because I am planning to immigrate into another country, so getting a degree there would be one of the best options for me, as I can't get a job in DS right away. During my university years, I've been introduced to most of the basic concepts of Statistics and Calculus. I've completed a few DS courses online together with some CS and Programming Extension courses.

4783,"Hi Ken, this is a great video. I appreciate you taking the time to talk about this topic in depth. If I heard correctly, you said it took you five years to get to where you are today. Can you shed some more light on that? During the last five years were you working as a data scientist/analyst, or is this something that you pursue in your spare time? 

I am wondering because I am trying to transition into a career related to data science. Specifically, I would to work in a role related quantitative research in the finance industry. I have been studying ~20 hours/week the last six months, and on and off the previous six months. I have been using resources such as Datacamp and Quantopian to practice and learn. However, it is frustrating that I am at the level that I would like to be at, and I am beginning to wonder if getting a masters degree in data science or financial engineering would be the better route.

inner join (select *
from dbo.Pitching
where W>=10) as pitch
on bat.playerID=pitch.playerID and bat.yearID=pitch.yearID

instead of using subquery in inner join, I use normal inner join and put W>=10 in where clause, which came out the same result:


select bat.*,pitch

inner join dbo.Pitching as pitch

I have been looking into transitioning to sports analytics as a new career option . I do have basic data science skills from my bioinformatics work experience but I don't have any specific projects I have done independently in the sports domain. Do you think it would be useful for me to pursue a sports analytics degree before I start looking for opportunities in this domain ? Or would the sports industry still consider me as an eligible candidate based on my programming/machine learning experience while handling big data in the biology domain, even if I don't have real-world experience in sports ?  I do follow several sports enthusiastically such as football, soccer and basketball and I am aware of all the terminologies associated with these sports. I'd really appreciate your feedback.

4888,"Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

more than 50% of every CS student seems to be interested in ML, but only a very small percentage of those really
commit to the entire journey, which I really want to do.

Helpful content nonetheless. I was accepted into three programmes and realised that only one of them had a robust syllabus. Strangely enough, it also happened to be the cheapest one!

Agreed that documentation is a plus for potential employers, a well documented code/notebook goes a long way in reproducibility of data science projects.

Generally I think the younger someone is
(or in general the earlier someone stands in their career/education)
the more impressive extraordinary projects become.
If you're a high school student and you create your own DS project whilst 
collecting own data, that is a lot more impressive than if you're in your final graduate year.
Even though it is never too late to start, I really want to try and make cool
projects early on so that I can build momentum as early as possible.
With the DS market becoming more and more competitive, I think these
uncommon achievements are going to be valued more and more,
especially in larger companies (FANG etc.) where already today
they are probably more of a requirement than an add-on.
Nevertheless, great video!

5033,"Hey Ken,
(warning: longer comment incoming)
I've been following you for a few months now and I've been thinking
""Man, I really need to write a comment stating how much I appreciate this channel"",
but I have been putting it of for long enough, this video finally drove me to the keyboard.
It is really inspiring to see you consistently trying to upload informative videos about Data Science
and really giving back to the community. You are a great motivation for me to keep going
and striving towards a career in Data Science (or even Machine Learning Engineering).
I clicked through your social links and noticed that you have a really well documented system
including your GitHub, personal website. Medium posts and this YouTube-Channel.
With a full time job besides all of that it is really impressive to me how you can manage all of these sources
and be so consistent with it. I'd love to have my project reviewed by you, even though at the moment my GitHub
is my least well documented source (xD). But you definitely inspired me to put more time and effort
into polishing personal projects and really not letting loose on those last 20%.
I am almost certain, that within a year or two your channel will become very impactful in the DS community
and that you will see very positive results. Your content is very informative and helping.
If I tried to point out some minor areas of improval it would actually not be based on the content itself, but rather
on aspects surrounding it (such as presentation, background noise, ... ) but I am sure you are aware of this,
recently I have noticed quite some improvement in those areas as well, so all I can say is chapeau!
I am really excited to see how far you will come in the next months, you definitely won me as a loyal fan of yours :)",UgwyHHBJKHrmTL-lH8t4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXOdh3pTBBovDXzkUkTuvKA,Boris Giba,3,3,2020-04-27 16:39:52+00:00,DW55gaQ_Egk,3,Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 1 (Exploratory Analysis),2020-04-27

I got on Kaggle for the first time and I was pretty excited to find these useable data sets to work on some of my data vis skills. Saw they were downloadable zip files and that immediately scared me, but I naively thought everyone else uses it and a quick google search brought up no safety concerns. After downloading about 3 data sets. I am pretty convinced i downloaded some malware. Got multiple warning signs from the browsers I use and then a bunch of random sites jumped up and teamviewer popped open. Immediately shut down and disconnected everything. Is this normal?

5299,"Hi Ken, 


Thank you for your advice! This has been very helpful as an aspiring data scientist. I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on this project I am currently working on and if it is good enough to put on my portfolio. To quickly summarize, I did EDA on my Spotify listening history and merged it with a Spotify features dataset that listed features of each song (For example, tempo, major, acousticness, and valence are a couple examples). I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the songs I usually listen to and the features. However, there was very little correlation so I said that the model (using multiple linear regression) I would build would be very inaccurate at predicting, and showed the inaccuracy by building it and finding its mean squared error (which was very large; although there were some predictions that were close). 


In your opinion, would this suffice as a good project? If not, do you have any insight on how I could improve?

In my humble opinion Data science has a lot to do with other aspects other than Machine learning. I realized many people focus a lot on machine learning which shrinks a lot of the aspects of data science. Kaggle, for example, encourages folks to hone their machine learning skills. Kaggle isn't a good place to learn full fledge data science skills. Data collection,  Data Cleaning, Data manipulation, Exploratory Data analyses where all left out. Kaggle mostly brings ready-made datasets which limits many kagglers the ability to effectively develop their data science skills.

One idea I haven't heard of before is focusing on one project and learning only the specific skills necessary for that project. Everyone's experienced the overwhelm when it comes to beginning the Data Science / ML / DL journey, and we're usually hit with the, ""learn all of statistics, all of programming, and all of math"" mentality that is drilled into our heads. This can be enough to scare people away, and your advice really combats this while touching on the idea of running on passion and things you enjoy by picking a personal project or use case.




It's really cool to see that you have a specific domain that you stay in for projects (sports and sports betting). My question is:


Do you stay within that domain at work?


If you do, do you suggest that we each choose a specific domain as well, and cater towards that when building a career and finding a job?
If you don't, would you agree that it's still valuable to choose a specific domain? Do you think that your experience and expertise in sports / sports betting transfers over to your current job/position?

And then moving the 3-point line a bit further away. I think this could eventually make the game more interesting. It only takes a bid getting used to 0.5 points; and if you are fouled while attempting a 2.5 point shot, the first time team gets 2 free-throws, next time this happens 3 free throws are rewarded.

5467,"Thanks for this video Ken. I have a sports analytics problem for you. When the 3 point shot was first introduced in the NBA, I said start launching them. Traditionalists said, oh no, too risky, too many will ruin the game. 20+ years later 3 point shots are an integral part of any teams' strategy. OK, my question is regarding the 2 point conversion in football. My belief is that the 2 point conversion should be tried every time. Once a team gets used to it they will develop special teams just for the conversion. Plus, once fully developed, these plays could be used for any regular down inside the 5 yard line. The amount of dedicated plays could be unlimited - 2 QB's on the field, 5 running backs, non-traditional formations, etc. Not to mention how exciting the game would become. Do you have any supporting evidence that, over time, going for the 2 point conversion 100% of the time would pay off? I guess part of your problem is that you cannot measure what hasn't been tried.",UgzbLTvd5RV4dt3l2O94AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1khGmcRcDoU8nByQ6C2Dzw,George M,1,1,2020-02-17 15:21:02+00:00,8igH8qZafpo,1,3 Proven Data Science Projects for Beginners (Kaggle),2020-02-17

How to implement Data Science into a working business?
Let's imagine you have a business that produces refrigerators. One single small factory, a sales team, etc.
I know that Data Science can help make any process more efficient, let it be the energy consumption, the production itself, supply chain, sales, marketing, etc.
What could one do to implement data collection and data analysis in a company like this to analyze data and drive insights to make a business more efficient? What are some real-life examples, software names, etc? What is your related real-life experience?
I don't ask for a whole sophisticated tutorial, the basic overview kind of information would be enough, so a person from a non-technical background could learn how to implement Data Science in business.

5502,"Ken, the 3 point shot means that defenses can no longer help against offensive ball penetration because 3 point shooters have become so expert and are stationed too far away from the basket.  With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop.  Basketball's offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined.  Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up.  When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game.  Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game.  If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game.

5583,"Great resolutions! Some of my comments:
1) Nice thought, but optimise for what makes sense to YOU, not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a ""good code"" by engineers. But obviously if you can't efficiently read/reason about your own code - then improvements are due! Functions/Objets aren't ALWAYS the right way forward, and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting ""classic"" code standards. Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both.
2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be ""consumed"" at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don't have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it's rather inefficient.
3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it!
4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it's like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don't change as often.
5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time.


My resolutions:
1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels.  NOT being just a ""cog"" in a chain, but truly understand meaning and impact of my work.
2) Get to a level of Master on Kaggle (same as your 4) if possible, or at least do a few public kernels.
3) Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren't data scientists can interact with (like that pix2pix live demo)
4) Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML
5) Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert
6) Improve my ability to read/analyse scientific papers. (So I don't have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what's going on in our field)
7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I've been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I'll be able to make it useful soon!

5601,"First off, it is good to know that I am getting into the field and not for the wrong reasons. Thanks for the insight!


Having committed myself to securing my spot in a masters in data science program at Denver. I think the number one driving factor in why I am even pursuing this field is I honestly believe there is a science to social interaction and I believe there can be an algorithm that can be created and used in conjunction with therapy for those who struggle with making friends, dating, establishing relationships, and even have difficulty developing APPROPRIATE humor. I have always wondered how some people can easily make friends, seem to easily talk with women and enter into relationships with ease, and how some people can have a sense of humor that gives off positive energy and draws people towards them. Then there are those that no matter how in shape they get, how good they may become at a given sport, they may try all sorts of meetup groups yet every attempt to make new friends seems futile. Making matters worse, these people who struggle may try and utilize humor only to end up being making more of a fool of themselves. 


This by no means will be an easy project and will require the skill-sets acquired from a masters program and even more and it will probably involve doing a number of large surveys and even designing an interface that can measure speech patterns and measure non_verbal body communication among several other variables such as proper clothing/color selection, ones facial attractiveness, ones health status, disabilities to name just a few. I feel an algorithm, involving highly complex mathematics, that can be implemented in therapy may be the answer to curing the loneliness epidemic, reducing addiction as a result of loneliness, and decrease mortality related to loneliness.  I am sure this is bordering if not even getting into the field of artificial intelligence.  There is a science to successful social interaction and it's time to dig deep into the data.",UgxVIPK5HqAMQZ1ubjl4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VGE_oMmD3qzI9yEco0I1w,Downhill D Miller,1,6,2019-12-17 00:33:45+00:00,m5pwx3hgtzM,1,3 Reasons You Should NOT Become a Data Scientist,2019-12-17

5619,"Ken, great stuff! Thanks for walking us through your simulation. 

Quick question: the way you calculate the score seems to skew the comparisons if one of the scores is high. 

For example:

If one team score is say 140-139 it averages to approx 140. The other team score is 120-90. It averages 105. So the team that won by 1 gets the win in the sim cause they scored a lot of points. But the other team won by 30 and had a better defense.

Do you see my point?

I'm thinking you ought to subtract and return a margin of victory then compare the margin of victory. Maybe worth running simulations to see how different they are?

 1. be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into learning (in truth, the learning never stops. üòÅ)
 2. be proactive about finding problems and solving them (plus, keep in mind there's a difference between asking for help because you're truly stuck vs. asking for help because you're too lazy to figure out how to solve a problem.

5728,"Hey Ken,  I have a few data science projects(python/sql) that i'm working on while taking edx classes but also work full-time as mech engineer trying to switch careers. The emphasis on masters seems to be quite apparent among DS jobs especially in Cali. 


If I want to go through masters in cs, i would have to be part-time(financial reasons) but also put all my projects on hold due to time constraint. It would take roughly 1 year for me to get around solid 4-5 projects to complete but 2.5 years for my masters.


What are your thoughts about this? going the personal project route or masters route? I wish I can do both but that is a recipe for a burnout. I enjoy the technicality of DS and want to get into the industry asap.

A very helpful video which made me confident that I am going in the right path. I am currently in Canada and about 90% of the DS job applications ask for either a masters/Ph.D. degree, which made me demotivated a little but your video motivated me to continue what I am doing right now.


I have made a Flask web app to predict the rent of apartments in Toronto. The model was trained on data scraped from various online portals and with the help fo third party API like walk score, HERE maps etc I was able to make a regression model.

The link to the app is: https://gtarent.herokuapp.com/ (not mobile friendly at the moment)

5760,"Hey PSA (maybe pin this or comment this yourself) but 1.2.0 as of right now doesn't really work. It's query_tweets is broken and you're going to have to specifically install 1.1.0 (pip install twitterscraper==1.1.0) in order to use it. 


Also, for anyone wondering about performance issues and harvesting tons of tweets, make use of the poolsize parameter. Poolsize controls the number of parallel scrapers you can have up at a single time. At maximum you can have one scraper per day. So for example, if you are scraping a period of 30 days, you can use poolsize=30 to get 30 parallel scrapers running at a time. If you want to harvest over a big time frame, try to harvest smaller time periods and loop through dates manually (otherwise your CPU, RAM, and internet usage will shoot through the roof). That should give you the best mix of performance and speed.",UgyUymUKeY7nfgJ8eYZ4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB4YFUFkEjfMc7bh1jWR91w,Benjamin Chen,3,2,2019-07-25 18:46:10+00:00,zF_Q2v_9zKY,3,Scrape Twitter Data in Python with Twitterscraper Module,2019-07-25

5772,"One more question, if I would like to write the tweets (from this method, with a track word) to a json file how do I access the tweet info?

For example, when I want to print the tweets: 

<twitterscraper.tweet.Tweet object at 0x10b0d8240>

I get something like this, which I understand but I'm not sure how to retrieve the actual information from it. Looking at API documentation, the tweet object should have attributes like 'text' and 'id' and so on. But when I try tweets['text'] I get an error instead. DO you know how I could write it into a file?

5784,"Hello everyone! Dan, one of my followers, pointed out that in this analysis I actually included the dependent variable (minutes played) many of the methods that I tested. Obviously, this is not something that you should do. After re-running the analysis with the correct adjustments made, these were my findings.


Just Previous Game Prediction Score:  7.991422567954051
Previous Three Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.937990350926065
Previous Five Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.82599267659377
Previous Ten Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.872496732886791
Previous Three Games Rolling Median Score:  7.233177023501123
Previous Five Games Rolling Median Score:  7.111145383454696
Previous Ten Games Rolling Median Score:  7.079332689005398


It looks like the past 5 game rolling average is actually the best performing of this group. 


Linear Model Performance: RMSE =  6.3429443807711765
Random Forest Performance: RMSE =  6.284779430662026
Combined Model Performance: RMSE = 6.276509665369035

As expected, the ensemble model performs the best. It appears that adding the linear component does provide a small amount of lift to the results.

5816,"Hi Ken, my name is Peter. I play a bunch of DFS and I do pretty well, but I have a glaring deficiency and it's my lack of programming / statistics skills. I enjoyed the video on NBA minutes. I think I have some ideas that could make your models even better than they already are, and we could both benefit. My email is PeterTaranovich@Gmail.com. Let me know if you have any interest in collaborating. Regardless, it's a great video and I appreciate you posting it.",UgzcouzpDyzGFyGQzwN4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3HMKKwHMQYhhzC1MZ3IiwA,PETER TARANOVICH,0,0,2019-01-18 05:48:37+00:00,sCOX5yShmFA,0,The Best Way to Predict NBA Minutes Played,2019-01-18

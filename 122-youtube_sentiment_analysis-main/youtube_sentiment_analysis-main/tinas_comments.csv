1. What kind of way for the test? generally  the master's degree need to write thesis for credit and graduate. but how is the MCIT course's test? it's same with other general offline grad schools? or there doesn't write the thesis?

2. Level of difficulty for graduate. I think, the many people will be retire on this program. i want to know the real experience for this level to graduate. when the beginning it can be easy. but I'm afraid the rapidly rising of the level.

3. The degree has same whit offlines? int the coursera site, there says that the degree are same with offlines. but i want to know when I apply for the companies. there doesn't need to reveal to online degree?",Ugws1BT5twvi6Lh108R4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk3sYdoFS53UHP_Yyz6lmlw,heskeybi,0,0,2020-11-25 01:47:44+00:00,KsQU_3n0IYE,0,My UPenn MCIT Experience,2020-11-25

Also, there are a variety of Latex resumes and Software Engineers who have gotten jobs using them, so I'm sure they don't have troubles with processing.

24,"This is one of the most realistic videos about the quant industry I've seen. They may not have touched on it, but the university you attend also matters. Coming from Canada, you need to attend Waterloo, UofT, or UBC to have the best chance at getting interviewed. 
...
Personally I recommend Waterloo's Computing and Financial Management undergrad. It's basically a double major between computer science and finance with 2 years of co-op. Every big company in US/Canada/China is recruiting nearly every semester. 
...
You've got Jane Street, GTS, Virtu, Citadel, DRW, Hudson River Trading, Capula, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Goldman, the Canadian banks, etc. 
Plus the smaller quant startups, and the usual suspects: Google (hires 20-75 students per term from Waterloo), Facebook (~10ish), Amazon, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, Tesla, Bloomberg, Microsoft, Darwin AI, and a ton of other tech companies from NY, Silicon Valley, Austin, and Toronto. There's usually about 4000-11,000 job postings per semester for tech.
...
Since y'all always want the pay figures, Citadel and Jane Street usually compete for highest compensation for interns. Pre-covid, it was $81-$83 USD per hour plus the housing stipend ($5000-$10,000 per month).",UgxOm1KJZFG2bEZHEyx4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe6E0z0gUCvyAOJQhGIJONg,Jack Barry,1,0,2020-11-18 16:05:47+00:00,_77TxNGR21A,1,Interview with a quant trader,2020-11-18

Do you think I should change my major to match those or do you think I should remain in the track that I am.

I'm a phd and struggle to graduate this semester, and spent so much time and found out I don't love it.  So I keep thinking where I will go, data scientist or software engineer?  I tried to make my phd degree add some value to my job application, originally, I thought data scientist might favor phd more over ms graduate, but my phd research was not about machine learning application and I could analyze my data just using excel,  do you have any suggestions for me? I wanna become a software engineer eventually, but I also wanna try data science to see whether I would love it or not, in this case, what I should do and prepare after I graduate to help me land my first job as soon as possible, thanks",UgxQKjzVPE4WCCRfHad4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClSYofCtyFBYr2F9Jy6ENMQ,Victor,2,0,2020-10-15 06:12:33+00:00,qg_THD1yLys,2,From Medical Doctor to Software Engineer | Humans of MCIT,2020-10-15

300,"I'm a prospective candidate for MCIT at the University of Pennsylvania for FALL 2021.I'm from India and I have a quite peculiar background. In India, the education system in high school is if we don't elect maths in Grade 11 and 12, we can't study it after in our college or in post-graduation at all. So I didn't have maths in my high school grade 12 and ended up taking a new course in my college called logistics management. It was quite astonishing that this course was introduced in my college just in 2014 and I joined the 3 rd batch of the program in 2017. In my college days, there wasn't any term called data science as such so if it was available I would have taken it. I had the constant love for I.T and computer though I didn't study in my undergrad at all. In India, it's difficult to study CS and I.T if you are not an engineering or CS grad. I came through an online course provider called Coursera and looked for the University of Pennsylvania's MCIT program. I'm interested for the on campus program of MCIT. The first-in-kind program made for Non- CS graduate and I was really happy seeing it. The beauty of US education is it's quite flexible and you can still pursue your dream even back when you couldn't due to some reasons.  I wanted to know some information about this program like what does the University of Penn looks while selecting a class from very diverse backgrounds and cultures. I want to be in the class of 2021 or 2022. How can I proceed further for this program? It would be a great help if you could guide me little. I'm an Aspiring data scientist and computer programmer. My CGPA is 7.54 on a 10 scale under indian system. I would be taking GRE soon . Shall I apply and give a shot ?

But I'm really confused as to how should I go learn Data Science. I am currently reading a book on Data Analytics and I am also following a Data Science course on Udemy. I just got done with NumPy and am practicing a few questions. Could you please guide me as to what I should do or how my path should look like? I'm looking forward to working with 2 sigma... What projects and models should I work on? Your help would be greatly appreciated.

449,"Arvind's post about MCIT Online vs. On Campus: 

These are not in any order of importance. I talked about the personal connection aspect first simply because that to me is the most significant one.

Number of electives - Whatever happens, I'll be extremely shocked if the number of electives in the online space becomes equal to the number of electives on campus. We, the faculty, get hired, to produce the on campus courses.

Variety of electives - As most of you know, you are allowed to take 1 approved non-CIS elective. This is a pretty popular option. No chance of doing this if you do the online version.

Research - Completely unclear to me how an online student gets to do research with faculty. Past cohorts (including the one that just graduated) have had at least one if not more students who have managed to work with our faculty on research projects. Some of them have gone on to do PhDs. No research --> very low chance of a PhD.

Going on to a dual degree with CIS, CGGT, Robo - Fairly sure that these are opportunities that only on-campus students have.

Mental health resources - CAPS is not something that online students have access to. I'm also not sure the students have access to the Weingarten learning center either.

Immigration - Online students cannot get an F-1 visa.

Recitations - Recitations in the online world do not have even 1/10th of the discussion and asking TAs questions that the on-campus world does. For certain topics, we feel that students explaining their thoughts to other students or talking to TAs makes a world of difference.

Who's teaching you - I'm putting this one last because I kinda feel awkward saying ""my team is the best"" (unless I'm at the Linc!). If you take a look at the last 7-8 years of MCIT on-campus teaching and the last 2 years or so of MCIT online teaching you will find that the MCIT core classes have always been taught by teaching track faculty. This is not the case with MCIT online. Teaching track faculty are instructors whose primary job description is teaching, and not research. Our tenure track/tenured faculty has many amazing teachers. But I'd like to think that being taught by teaching track faculty as opposed to tenure track/tenured faculty in that important and formative first year can make a difference.",Ugz-kcxlCdNc65g32jd4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww,Tina Huang,3,2,2020-08-30 23:09:08+00:00,rd1HKwJT6GM,3,Upenn MCIT Program Details and Real Student Experiences - Dr. Arvind Bhusnurmath,2020-08-30

For months I wasn't sure which route I wanted to take because I really liked both of them and couldn't decide.
A few weeks ago I woke up one morning and ""just knew"" that I wanted to become an ML engineer,
I don't know why but since then I've been really sure about that. In the past I worked both on SW as well as DS projects and 
I found that I really enjoy the engineering aspect of software as well as the data and machine learning aspect of DS, so
maybe that was the reasoning behind that. Nevertheless this video definitely reassured my decision! I guess I really like building stuff more than I like discovering it.

453,"Hey Tina,
I'm basically just watching all of your videos in a row now so expect some more comments from me haha
I'm just really curious and I haven't found a lot of people with exactly this situation and I feel like I am in a similar situation as you were a few years ago.
So back then you weren't a US citizen (did you live in the US?) and you just applied to a lot of companies online and then later heard back from a few of them, right?
Did you only apply to one location specifically or to multiple ones? Did the company then just handle the visa etc. for you?
I'm from Europe and looking into internships opportunities for the next year. I just wondered if it is ""ok"" to send out applications to company locations outside one's current residence, because so far I kind of thought that was absurd or unrealistic (of course there are opportunities here too, just not that many).
I know I'm just throwing a bunch of questions at you and I really don't want to take a lot of your time but I just had to ask😅",UgzNf5i7AXLPtkG3L-B4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXOdh3pTBBovDXzkUkTuvKA,Boris Giba,2,0,2020-08-26 19:38:53+00:00,Rx1i1J4m4MQ,2,How I got Software Engineering and Data Science Internships | Computer Science Job Search Part 1,2020-08-26

This gives some context though and that it's normal to not know all the answers to interview questions simply because you haven't had the relevant classes yet. It's also interesting that so much of the interview took place virtually - I'm guessing that is how things will be for the time being as well, including the final round most likely.

491,Hi Tina! Congratulations on landing a full-time DS job!  I found out about your videos through RTC and they have been v insightful. I have a couple of questions about your DS application experience. How did you study SQL by yourself? Are there any specific resources you'd recommend? I am also wondering what kind of technical questions did you encounter in your DS interviews. Were they similar to SWE interview questions (you mentioned some of these in your Part 1 video)? Would you recommend brushing up on data structures and general leetcode questions for data science interview as well?

493,"Great video! Thank you so much for sharing!  I have a question about the job application process.  I’m not familiar with the MCIT program, but I just finished a DS bachelor degree.  I found myself lacking some of the skills and requirements the companies ask for in SWE OR DS roles .  Have you ever faced a situation like this?  Do you just self-study those tools and learn those skills if your program’s course curriculum didn’t prepare you for those requirements?  Another question is, had you worked on any side projects in software engineering or data science? Or do you just put class projects on your resume/profile?  I would like to figure out how much time I should put on side projects if they are essential to job applications.  Im sorry for asking so many questions, and thank you again for making these videos that help us gain so much more insights on DS and CS internships/jobs!",UgyND4QaCw4RQ49lert4AaABAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHJisU-mqWiVUILOOvBy_w,kc121638,2,0,2020-08-06 00:19:46+00:00,-zQ-Pf491bQ,2,How I Became a Data Scientist | Computer Science Job Search Part 2,2020-08-06

(1)resume/portfolio for internship
- The importance of portfolio and how to build it during the semester)
(2)schedule management for internship application 
- When to update resume, apply, prepare for LeetCode etc.
- I'd also like to ask if you recommend applying late so that I have enough preparation prior to the interview or apply early before all the spots get filled up

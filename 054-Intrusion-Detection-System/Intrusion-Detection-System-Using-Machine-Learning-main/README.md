# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning

This repository contains the code for the project "Intrusion Detection System Development for Autonomous/Connected Vehicles". In this project, two papers have been published:  
* L. Yang, A. Moubayed, I. Hamieh and A. Shami, "[Tree-Based Intelligent Intrusion Detection System in Internet of Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08635.pdf)," 2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2019, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013892.  
* L. Yang, A. Moubayed, and A. Shami, “[MTH-IDS: A Multi-Tiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13289.pdf),” IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 2021, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2021.3084796.

It proposed two **intrusion detection systems** by implementing many **machine learning** algorithms, including tree-based algorithms (**decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, etc.**), unsupervised learning algorithms (**k-means**), ensemble learning algorithms (**stacking**), and hyperparameter optimization techniques (**Bayesian optimization**)**.

- Another **intrusion detection system development code** using **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** and **transfer learning** techniques can be found in: [Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning](https://github.com/Western-OC2-Lab/Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning)

- A comprehensive **hyperparameter optimization** tutorial code can be found in: [Hyperparameter-Optimization-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms](https://github.com/LiYangHart/Hyperparameter-Optimization-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms)


## Implementation 
### Dataset 
CICIDS2017 dataset, a popular network traffic dataset for intrusion detection problems
* Publicly available at: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html  
* For the purpose of displaying the experimental results in Jupyter Notebook, the sampled subsets of CICIDS2017 is used in the sample code. The subsets are in the "data" folder.

CAN-intrusion dataset, a benchmark network security dataset for intra-vehicle intrusion detection
* Publicly available at: https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/CAN-intrusion-dataset  
* Can be processed using the same code

IoT and ML based Project

Small children while watching TV often reach quite close to the TV screen which can cause degradation of retina and poor eye sight. For the safety of their eyes we built a solution i.e., TV Prototype. The whole system was programmed with the help of Raspberry Pi Model B. The Ultrasonic sensor is used for calculating the distance from the TV screen. The inbuilt Haarcascade feature of OpenCV is used for detecting the childs face and eyes. After child reaches quite closer i.e., inside the critical distance to the TV screen, the TV screen is switched off for 1 minute. The target audience of the system is the small childrens. The goal is to break the habit of watching the TV from closer distance of small childrens.

Segmenting customers into High, low and mid value CLTV and devising relevant strategies for each type of customer.

* 	Define an appropriate time frame for Customer Lifetime Value calculation (6 months old customers or 3 months old etc.)
*  Identify the features we are going to use to predict future and create them. Create clusters based on features which can help segment customers and add these clusters with the original data.
* 	Calculate lifetime value (LTV) for training the machine learning model.

    <b> Lifetime Value: Total Gross Revenue - Total Cost </b>
* 	Build and run the machine learning model
* 	Check accuracy of model and improve it.

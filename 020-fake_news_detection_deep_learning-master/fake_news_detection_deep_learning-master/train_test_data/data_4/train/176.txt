dogs wolves genetically
idea domestic dog descended grey wolf originally established using comparisons wolf dog mitochondrial
investigation showed living animal closely related domestic dog grey domestic dog extremely close relative grey differing
mitochondrial dna passed mother genetic contribution changes random mutations occur generation
scientists use much smaller separate dna sequence estimate populations animals first estimate evolutionary relationships
new technology allowed scientists map much longer dna sequence found chromosomes wolves dogs genes actually code physical traits
studies demonstrated similarity dog grey covered review paper domestic dog extremely close relative grey differs nuclear dog found show closer kinship canid
similarity profound often occurs dogs
biological definition would mean domestic dog subspecies grey wolf lupus
remains appropriate classification domestic dog would arguing domestic dog distinct species
genetic analysis allowed scientists well pin probable timing split two canid
study published compared whole sequence dogs year old wolf suggested split likely occurred years domestic dogs likely grey

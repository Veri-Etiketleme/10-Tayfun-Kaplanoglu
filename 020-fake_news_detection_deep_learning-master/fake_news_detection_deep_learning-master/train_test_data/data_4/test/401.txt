mcconnell witha previous statement offered byjon republican senator said find interesting argument candidates ideology sufficient rationale rejection characterized bipartisan
would think bipartisanship would mean quite
cooperation president bipartisan basis dont think begins threat going reject matter might dont like political interpret
think make mistake suggested significant departure way nominees traditionally
quite assuredly prove rule exceptions general deference always given presidents
bipartisan point concerns believe puts us dangerous path confrontation contention within well relationship senator sessions creates bad
also found interesting chairman alluded president bushs campaign theme frankly reaction made clear president bush would putting strict constructionists like justice thomas justice scalia supreme
think correct characterization tradition president
president right even though close
president bush think democrats campaigned basis would try appoint people consistent judicial philosophy correct saying would would end senate always confirmed nominees less president regardless close election
president never majority citizens country vote gave significant deference
point us political figures politics try translate political views onto courts job maintain balance sheer

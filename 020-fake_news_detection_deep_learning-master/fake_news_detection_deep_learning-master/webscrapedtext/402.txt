			Actor Andrew Lincoln's father was in a 1972 plane crash in the Andes mountain and survived by eating the other passengers.							See Example( s )

A meme claiming that Andrew Lincoln (a star of the zombie hit television show The Walking Dead) is the son of a survivor of the 1972 Andes flight disaster, and that the actor used his father’s experience with cannibalism as the inspiration for the character Rick Grimes, has been circulating on the internet for several years:
 
The above-displayed meme was originally posted to the “Interesting Facts” page of the IHatePeacocks2.com web site in August 2014. While this web page is full of “interesting” claims, none of them should be considered facts:
We here at the ihatepeacocks command center are commited to bringing you only the best in Soft Serve Technology and Preimium lulz at discount prices. And by discount we mean free.
We are nerds and we make bad jokes and funny pictures.
The “Interesting Facts” page is full of humorous but incorrect claims, such as Kim Jong-Un being roommates with the dark lord Cthulhu in college, but the web site’s intent can be summed up with one of its own memes:
 
Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crashed in the Andes Mountains in 13 October 1972. While sixteen passengers did ultimately survive the ordeal (and some did, famously, have to resort to cannibalism to do so) none of the survivors carried the name “Lincoln,” nor the actor’s family name (Clutterbuck).
While several profiles of the actor mention Lincoln’s father, a businessman, none mention any connection to the 1972 Andes flight disaster:
Born Andrew Clutterbuck (thank heavens for Equity and stage names) in Hull, he grew up in Bath, the younger son of a businessman and a psychiatric nurse.
A summer with the National Youth Theatre scuppered a vague idea of becoming a vet and, as the acting bug took hold, he dropped one of his A-levels and concentrated on auditions. His father told him he would only be allowed to go to drama school if he received offers from five or more. “That was my father,” shrugs Lincoln. “It was a very good thing, though because it really whittled out a burning desire in me.” Having obediently gained places at the top five schools, he enrolled at Rada, paying his way with jobs as a commis chef, a barman and in one of his father’s factories making car exhausts.
This meme (along with the rest of the memes from this particular site) is a joke and not at all based on factual information.

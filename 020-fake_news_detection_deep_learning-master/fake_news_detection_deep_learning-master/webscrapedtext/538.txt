			A list of 'A Country Founded by Geniuses but Run by Idiots' entries originated with comedian Jeff Foxworthy.							See Example( s )

The above-referenced list of entries detailing “A Country Founded by Geniuses But Run by Idiots” was widely circulated via the Internet in early 2013 with an “Attibuted to Jeff Foxworthy” tag at its head, leading many to believe it was actually the work of that nationally famous comedian.
However, othen than its basic “If you … you might be …” pattern that mimics Jeff Foxworthy’s popular “You might be a redneck” routines, this item bears little resemblance to anything produced by Foxworthy: his comedic material is typically affectionate and self-deprecating and involves poking fun at his own milieu; his brand of humor is much more apolitical and non-partisan than the list reproduced above. (Nonetheless, Jeff’s name has been falsely attached to other similar political pieces that have little in common with the tenor and substance of his comedy material.)
Jeff’s brother, Jay, confirmed for us that this material was not written by his sibling. The original compiler of this list appears to be Fritz Edmunds, who posted it to his “Politically True” blog back on 3 February 2013 (albeit with a disclaimer noting that “some of the ideas were from an e-mail that did not contain any copyright”).
As usual, the list has seen numerous alterations in the process of being passed around the Internet, and several of the entries appearing in earlier versions have since dropped off:
If the only school curriculum allowed to explain how we got here is evolution, but your government stops a $15 million construction project to keep a rare spider from evolving to extinction … you might live in a country founded by geniuses and run by idiots.
If your government believes that using steroids or other drugs will ruin your life, but throwing you in prison for years will not … you might live in a country founded by geniuses and run by idiots.
If children are forcibly removed from parents who discipline them with spankings while children of addicts are left in filth and drug infested “homes” … you might live in a country founded by geniuses and run by idiots.
If your government believes that the way to make a school of unarmed children safe is to pass another law, this time with the illusion that three 10-round magazines in a rifle is safer than a 30-round magazine … you might live in a country founded by geniuses and run by idiots.

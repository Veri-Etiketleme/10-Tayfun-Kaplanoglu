			CNN showed an altered version of a tweet written by Donald Trump during a news segment.							See Example( s )

During the CNN news program “Newsroom” on 28 August 2016, the cable news station showed a graphic image quoting a tweet authored by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump — but the graphic aired by CNN was missing an insult Trump habitually includes when talking about his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton:
I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2016

The CNN graphic dropped the word “crooked” from the wording, as can be seen in the transcript from the program hosted by Jim Sciutto. The discrepancy was noticed the next day by right wing blogs, including Truthfeed, which called CNN the “Clinton News Network” in its 29 August 2016 post on the topic:
It is not the job of a legitimate news network to remove adjectives to make Hillary more palatable. Of course, CNN is not a real news network, they are far left globalist propaganda news as they have proven once again.
CNN (which actually stands for Cable News Network) updated their story on 29 August 2016 to reflect that Trump had tweeted the phrase “Crooked Hillary” — a phrase he employs almost every time he references his opponent.

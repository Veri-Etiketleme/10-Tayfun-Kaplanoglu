			A photograph shows several large whales feeding near a tiny boat.							See Example( s )

A striking image purportedly showing several large whales gathered around a small fishing boat is frequently shared on social media as a genuine photograph. The image is, however, a composite of at least two different pictures. 
The original image of the whales was taken by photographer Scott Methvin, and uploaded to his Facebook page on 6 January 2016:

Methvin was also responsible for the other —digitally manipulated — image, which he shared to his Facebook page in May 2016. While Methvin didn’t initially post the image with a message informing viewers that it had been digitally altered, he did post a follow-up photograph showing how a boat would actually look next to the whales:

No Photoshop, real scale.
When another Facebook page shared the image and attributed it to a different photographer, Methvin chimed in to claim ownership of the photograph, explaining how and why he created the image:
This is my PHOTOSHOPPED image. Someone took my name off of it. I did it for fun and took two photos and combined them. The (other photographer) grabbed it from a mutual “friend.” The scale is rediculous and was funny to me, so I made it. It is actually my first PS composite I ever made. Given the viral nature of this image, maybe I should make some more and do a cleaner job.

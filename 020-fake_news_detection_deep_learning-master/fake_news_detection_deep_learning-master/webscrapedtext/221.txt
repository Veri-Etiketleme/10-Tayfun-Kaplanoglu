			Romanian newspaperman Cornel Nistorescu penned a pro-America editorial immediately after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.							See Example( s )

Americans were pleased, gratified, and fascinated when newspapers in other countries ran strongly pro-American articles in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, as indicated by the resurgence of interest in Canadian Gordon Sinclair‘s 28-year-old radio broadcast and the tremendous amount of attention paid to the Romanian newspaper editorial quoted above.  Since the editorial as circulated via e-mail was undated, untitled, and unsigned; contained no publication information whatsoever; and was a translation of an article not originally printed in English, tracking it to its source was not an easy task back in October of 2001.
This editorial was written by Mr. Cornel Nistorescu, managing editor of the Romanian newspaper Evenimentul Zilei, in which his piece was published under the title “Cîntarea Americii” (translated into English as “Ode to America”) on 24 September 2001.
The Associated Press reported of Mr. Nistorescu that:

Nistorescu, managing director of the daily newspaper Evenimentul Zilei — News of the Day — published his editorial Sept 24, two days after watching a celebrity telethon in New York for victims of the attacks.
Like his other columns, “Ode to America” was meant for domestic consumption. No one knows when — or how — the article first reached the other side of the Atlantic. But Nistorescu figures it began when someone pulled it off the English-language version of his daily’s Web page and sent it to a friend. 
Since then, thousands of Americans at home and expats around the world have e-mailed it to friends, saying it captured their nation’s spirit. It has been read out to U.S. soldiers and on radio talk shows and posted on U.S. Web sites. 
Nistorescu says he had no idea his “Ode to America” would resonate so far away.
Nistorescu remains surprised and touched by the success of the piece, one of thousands he has penned in a more than 20-year career. 
“It is all about the American spirit and how freedom cannot be crushed,” he says.

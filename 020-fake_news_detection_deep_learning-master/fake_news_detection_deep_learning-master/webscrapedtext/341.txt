			Fox News contributor Michelle Fields said that "we shouldn't just give money to people simply because they are old."							See Example( s )

In August 2015 the above-reproduced image was shared to the Facebook page “International Community,” featuring a screenshot of Fox News pundit Michelle Fields with the following text:
Fox News ‘Expert on Social Security Michelle Fields: “We shouldn’t simply give social security to people because they are old.”
Fox News — FIRE MICHELLE FIELDS
We paid for Social Security, it is our property. Want to see 50 million real pissed off old people, with guns and no reason to live, try to steal what we have paid for.
The remark was one Fields made during a panel discussion on Social Security, only the second half of which was reproduced in the image.  Fields wasn’t suggesting Social Security be abolished entirely; she was positing that Social Security funds be attached to some form of means test so that recipients with greater financial need would have priority:
“We should give money to people who need it, who are in need … we shouldn’t just give money to people simply because they are old.”


Michelle Fields was a regular panelist on the Fox News weekend program Cashin’ In, but she was dropped from the show in March 2016 after filing a police report against Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, for assaulting her.
The battery charge against Lewandowski was dropped, and in May 2016 Fields was hired by the Huffington Post to cover Trump’s campaign.

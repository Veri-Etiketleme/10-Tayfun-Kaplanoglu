It’s the kind of story you’d think was fake, but this time it’s more fowl than foul.
As bird-brained as it might seem, KFC New Zealand did indeed announce on 1 December 2016 that it was giving away a “KFC Scented Candle.” Fans of the fast food chain’s social media accounts entered the draw by suggesting their own merchandising ideas for the Kentucky-based company.
The company credited KFC New Zealand’s digital marketing director, Emma Ye, with the concept, with U.S. marketing director Clark Wilson saying the response was “overwhelming”:
We’ve already been approached by people willing to pay over NZ$100 for a KFC Candle. We’ve got no intention to commercially produce the candles, but given their popularity, Enna may have to go into full time production.
Just three candles were given away during the special offer, on 5 December 2016.

On 22 March 2016, a terrorist attack involving explosives detonated at an airport and a subway station in Brussels, Belgium, killed at least 30 people:
The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a series of deadly terrorist attacks that struck Brussels, killing at least 30 people at the city’s main international airport and in a subway station at the heart of the city, near the headquarters of the European Union.
The deadly violence began shortly before 8 a.m. with an explosion in the departure terminal at Brussels Airport, followed shortly by another. Then, at 9:11 a.m., a bomb tore through the last car of a subway train as it was pulling out of the Maelbeek station.
At least 30 people were killed: around 10 at the airport and 20 at the subway station — and more than 230 others were wounded.
Shortly after the attack, a video that purportedly captured one of those explosions began started circulating on Twitter, posted by the VRT deredactie.be news outlet. A version of the video was also circulated via YouTube:

			Marilyn Mosby posted (and then deleted) a picture showing her daughter in the ballot booth							See Example( s )

Much like Eric Trump (son of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump), Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby tweeted, then scrubbed, a picture that violated voting regulations.
The image, which was circulated online and in news reports, showed Mosby’s daughter holding a pen while standing inside what appeared to be a voting booth and looking at a blank ballot.
Mosby also tagged Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the picture alongside a caption indicating Clinton was Mosby’s choice:
“We Voted Today #DoYourPartAndDoTheSame #We’reWithHer
We’ve reached out to both the State’s Attorney office and Mosby’s spokesperson for comment on the picture, which Mosby has since deleted. 
Maryland state election regulations stipulate that neither cell phones nor cameras can be used at  polling locations, unless election officials or police do so while “acting in their official capacities.” News outlets may also use cameras inside a polling place as long as they are not filming touchscreens or ballots. 
Mosby’s daughter joining her at the polls is not a violation, since parents are allowed to bring children under the age of 18 into voting areas “as long as they do not disrupt or interfere with normal voting procedures.”

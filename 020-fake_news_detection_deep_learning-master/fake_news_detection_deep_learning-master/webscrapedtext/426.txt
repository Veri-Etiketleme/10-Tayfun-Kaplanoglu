			A photograph shows Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and George Wallace together at a table.							See Example( s )

On 16 February 2016, a photograph purportedly showing Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and George Wallace at a table was posted to a Facebook group along with the caption “Planning for ‘The New World Order'”:

The above-displayed meme was shared to a page called: “Our NEXT President Bernie” in an apparent attempt to either show that American politics consists of a relatively small group of co-conspirators, to discredit Bush and Clinton by linking them to former Alabama governor George Wallace (who was well-known for being a segregationist in the 1960s), or both.
Although it’s difficult to tell the motivation for sharing the above-displayed photograph with this particular caption, it is real. CBS News, which included the photograph in a gallery of images from Wallace’s political career, reported that the photograph was taken in 1983, at Bush’s residence in Kennebunkport, Maine.
At the time, Bush was serving as vice president under Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton was the governor of Arkansas, and George Wallace was at the beginning of his final term as governor of Alabama:
Wallace and his third wife, the former Lisa Taylor, meet with Vice President George Bush and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton at a lobster bake at Bush’s residence at Kennebunkport, Maine, July 30, 1983. The third Mrs. Wallace, whom the governor married in 1981, was 30 years his junior and half of a country-western singing duo, Mona and Lisa, who had performed during his campaign in 1968.
  It’s true that this photo is of the three politicians sitting together, and while it’s impossible to tell what they’re discussing in the photo, it clearly shows a common occurrence: politicians hobnobbing and shaking hands.
